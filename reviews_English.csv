,"Appearance: Star Ring yyds are very nice! ! Running speed: Needless to say, the UI animation of Hongmeng system fluency, as a user of Huawei Xiaoquanjia, I like this system very much. Screen sound effect: The screen is really off the mark. It should be from BOE. I just felt something wrong when I turned it on. Why is it green and yellow? Later, compared with the p20Pro of n years ago, I opened the setting interface. Although the official data of the m40p surpasses the screen parameters of the p20Pro in all aspects, the naked eye clearly feels that the Samsung OLED of the p20Pro is much brighter and more realistic. I have fiddled with the settings of the color temperature, vivid mode, etc., but it still doesn't work. Although the green edge has long been psychologically prepared, I am very dissatisfied with the display quality of the entire screen. Later, I used two devices to play the same video, and it can only be said that there are gaps in the details. ?The following picture is from Xiaopozhan, which is my intuitive feeling when I see the screen.... Everyone has different sensitivity to color and clarity, and the acceptance of the screen varies from person to person. Most users think that the screen has no question. Some people also say that the Samsung A screen is too bright, and now this screen is more realistic, but I still prefer bright colors. You should be able to get used to it. I just bought the matepad 12.6 last year and I felt that the text was a little blurry, but after all, the screen is big, and the video is really fragrant after watching. Other features: body balance, still like > uncomfortable (to be honest, as a Hongmeng ecological user, there is no other suitable mobile phone to consider). It is expected that BOE can break through the restrictions and supply top-notch screens.

In fact, 22/40 watts are enough, and 66 watts are a bit more expensive! Mobile phone photography is still very powerful, just take a picture and you're done! I don't play games, so I won't comment on this! The last thing to say is that a lot of photo and video data is lost in mobile phone cloning, so it is recommended to use a computer to reverse photos and videos.

I have never played a large-scale mobile game, and I don¡¯t know if it is the APP or the system. The power consumption is very fast, and it is charged three times a day. , Compared with the fruit machine, the battery has no obvious advantage.

When I read the evaluation, I was really looking forward to Huawei, but when I got it, I really felt that this mate40rs was no different from the iPhonexr I bought three years ago. I thought it would be much faster, but it's not. I'm a little disappointed here. Standby time: I just got it and used it a lot. Yesterday, I charged it twice a day. I'll try it later. Other features: I think the biggest feature is the signal. Because the house is relatively large, routers are installed in each room. I used Apple before, and the signal is really bad. I can't switch freely when I walk to each room, and I need to manually switch. After switching, the signal is still very poor. This paired with a Huawei router really made me realize that the network speed is super fast (the mobile phone card is still a 4G card and has not been replaced). As an Apple switch to Huawei, I feel that the biggest change is that the two systems have their own advantages and disadvantages. Apple is relatively purer, although After upgrading Hongmeng, there are still various software and various messages disturbing. After struggling between 13 Xiang and Porsche for a long time, I finally chose Porsche. To be honest, I didn't feel much surprise when I got it.

,"Very good, it took me a few days to comment, it's worth having",,"Powerful video shooting! good, praise",
,"Appearance: From the Liu Haiping of the first-generation mate20Pro to the present, the screen ratio of the pills is much larger. If it is a single hole, it will be more perfect, but 3D face recognition is required, so the screen sound effect can also be understood: mate20Pro is a domestic 2K , Although the display is not as good as Samsung's 2k, it is not bad. The mate40rs screen is a Samsung screen without lottery. Although it is not 2k, it is still a little more delicate than the domestic 2k display. The photo effect: the 20Pro's photo was also the only one. The mate series has always been the vanguard of photography. The 40rs has 5 cameras, and all functions are readily available. There is no one to make up for it. The ultra-wide-angle telephoto zoom plus a free-form lens, the anti-distortion effect is first-class. Running speed: no It¡¯s a bit of a pity to grab the 12+ running memory. Fortunately, this 8+ version came out later. Although it is slightly insufficient, with the blessing of the Hongmeng system, any shortcomings are nothing but this. The Hongmeng widgets play Thief slipping, with a little more small components in the future, the playability will be higher. Standby time: Although the 4400mah battery is a little less in front of the general 4500 or even 5000, but with the blessing of the Hongmeng system, the standby time is not worse than them, just like Apple's iOS system adds less than 4000 batteries, the battery life is still resistant, and 40rs is even worse",,"In fact, I still have OPPO's flagship phone.

I just want to say that I bought a mobile phone for more than 10,000 yuan, and the paint peeled off within a few days. Isn't this a quality problem? Is it a system problem called a quality problem?

,"Let me tell you how I felt in the last month. I bought a Xiaomi selfie stick, a Philips power bank, an Oral B toothbrush, a Shiseido, an Apple 12promax, and a Huawei p40pro on JD.com in the last month.

You dare to put your mobile phone in the express supermarket, right? You are not afraid of losing it, or you are not afraid of losing it and then paying for it? Or you won't pay if you lose it? The 12promax I bought also overturned. This after-sales experience is the worst I have ever experienced. I have put all the offline quality inspection reports in it. Does it take 3 days to test a mobile phone? As of the time I wrote this comment, it was still being tested. The customer service asked several times and nothing was resolved. They said that there was a special person to follow up on this matter. As a result, I didn't even receive a call. How about testing a wool? The last month and a half of logistics services and this after-sales experience have made me have no good feelings for Jingdong before! ! ! !

I hope Huawei can still retain this flat screen in the later stage and provide optional opportunities for those in need. I don't like curved screens very much, so I bought this one. Screen sound effect: I feel that the sound is low, and the external sound is not loud. Photo effect: The photo is still very clear. When taking portraits, the skin on the face is also naturally beautiful. The skin on the face is not smooth, but the wrinkles and spots are clearly visible. Running speed: I have always been a fan of Huawei, but the operation of this phone is really a card. It has been used for a long time. Sometimes I want to open it~ I can't open it.

I don't know if there are too many apps on the phone, or it takes up too much memory. I am not satisfied with this. I hope the engineer will use it in the later design. Do more work on this. Standby time: The standby time is short. Before a party is over, the photos are not finished, and the phone is out of power. One night, I opened a shopping APP and did not watch the video. The battery turned yellow in the morning of the second day. It took me a while to evaluate it. I have never mentioned that there are so many dissatisfactions with the new mobile phone in my hand. It seems that it is not worthy of the price. There are many shortcomings, so come on! Many mobile phones at home are from Huawei, and I am a loyal fan of Huawei. I have used the m and P series.

I went downstairs to pick up a courier. , but the memory of the newly bought mobile phone is still enough, but there is no way to open WeChat to scan the code, and after a long time, it cannot be opened to scan the barcode of the express cabinet. This one does not feel as good as the P20 sold in previous years. I hope that the quality of the mobile phone battery can be taken into account when the new product is released. The size of this mobile phone is more suitable for girls. I hope it can make the battery more durable and ensure the smoothness of the machine.

I used to feel that the Internet was a sunspot, but now I feel that the experience is so bad that it makes you collapse, and it is completely IQ tax.

,"The face value is very high. After waiting for many days, I am still a little unaccustomed to using a Huawei mobile phone for the first time, but it feels good in the hand and supports domestic products.",,"But why is there no charger, so annoying",
,Looking forward to the new machine,,"Good good, support domestic products, support Huawei",
,"I originally used an Apple mobile phone, but it didn't work well, and it was smashed! Now the Huawei mobile phone is very easy to use, I like it very much!",,"This apple has only been used for less than 6 months. I just picture it as small in size, and my hand is also small! But only after using it did I realize that I had to charge it twice a day for two hours, and the charging interface was not good, so I changed several data cables! From time to time, it heats up for no reason, and once the heat is generated, the power drops a lot. The network is not good, and it is guaranteed that there is no signal when entering a building. Running takeaway outside the phone is hot and dead! Can you **** believe it? Now other mobile phones at the same price are not as good as it, not to mention it has been used for a long time, isn't it fragrant when I replace it with a new phone every year?",
,Just started playing and don't know how?,,The battery life is hundreds of times better than those of the 13,
,"Photo effect: a little disappointed. Known as the primary color, the actual color difference is a bit large, not as good as my previous P20PRO. Under the sun, some overexposed",,"For bad reviews, the system defaults to 5 stars, but I was so angry that I forgot to change it. The middle one is half indoor, the other two are under the sun, the exposure is too strong, is this the primary color? The color difference is too great. White balance is not good. There is an improvement in taking pictures at night, but it feels like it's not worth it if it comes at the expense of taking pictures during the day",

,The mobile phone that went on sale in August is now out of warranty,,There is no warranty and no rights and interests. JD.com and Huawei have officially checked for the fourth day. No news as of today,
,"I don¡¯t often buy mobile phones online. I have to understand different things about bare metal. The option is to choose wireless charging, um! I think about it, I don't need it. But I need a charger, and it's the first time I found out that a bare-ass cell phone was delivered without a cable. I really didn't understand your purchase box. I really can't give this praise",,"It has been used for more than ten days. To be honest, I personally think that the battery storage capacity is not as durable as that of the p40 pro.",
,"It is still a matter of habit to make domestic products self-improvement, so I still bought Huawei P50Pro. I didn't fully understand it at first. However, domestic high-end phones have to look at Huawei, and other mobile phones have to work hard! American devil is a little bit inauthentic",,Still in development. Appearance is very good,

,"Don't bring a charger, don't prompt, and don't say it officially, you will affect the experience too much.",,"I have been using Huawei all the time. I was full of expectations. After waiting for 5 days, it turned out to be a bare machine. I am so disappointed.",
,"Trust Huawei, Support Huawei",,"I hope to make up for the difference and change to the 5G version in the future, it will be great! Live up to those who still support 4G at this moment",
,"The appearance is very good, the system is very smooth, I received it the next day, very comfortable, much better than my old Huawei mobile phones. Thanks to the choice of 66W charging, or there is no charger, it is a pity.

,"The phone responds really fast, and the charging is also fast, which is good",,Very poor fingerprint recognition,
,"Huawei, which has been used for so many years, is getting better and more expensive, but fortunately, a mobile phone can be used for two or three years. I've been following mate40pro for half a year, I couldn't get it at first, and then I'm waiting for the 5G version when it's in stock, but it's still out of stock after half a year. Just waiting for the news of p50, I didn't participate in the scheduled snap-up, I thought I was not so lucky. A few days ago, I accidentally refreshed and found that it was in stock. I quickly placed an order and waited three days to receive the goods. The unpacking was perfect. The p50 photo is really too ##, you don't need to carry a big SLR when you go out",,The battery doesn't feel very durable. I charge it twice a day. Maybe the phone is too easy to use. I use it more frequently than before.,

,"Bad reviews, bad reviews, bad reviews, don't be deceived anymore, you spent more than 7,000 yuan, and there is no charger in it.

Absolutely bad review, now it's marketing false propaganda, no apology and attitude! Bad review, please keep your eyes open if you want to buy it, and would rather choose other affordable brands than buy this one that doesn't even have a charger",

,"As a 3976-day veteran user, I have always had a good impression of JD.com. This time I can't stand it, so I can only give a bad review. When I received the mobile phone, the Jingdong carton was well packaged outside, but when I opened it, the four corners of the box of the mobile phone itself were obviously dropped. This makes me how to send people. Because of the rush to send, the exchange time cannot be long. When I asked the customer service how long it would take to exchange the goods, the customer service of JD.com and the customer service of Huawei's self-operated store kicked the ball back and forth, and did not give a clear answer how long it would take to exchange the goods. Finally, the customer service of JD.com said that they would verify the situation. It turned out that to verify the situation, the courier brother who delivered the goods called me and asked if the packaging was damaged. The outer packaging is really not broken, and I can't cheat my brother. It has nothing to do with him. I can only honestly say that the outer packaging is intact. This is done, forget it, I won't give gifts anymore, take it apart and use it yourself",,"The packaging box is like this, and the picture review is not approved. It really belongs to you. send it again",

,"Who said ugly, the real machine is very good. The p40 pro was replaced just because 128G was not enough. It took a long time to arrive. Is it hungry marketing? It's still really out of stock, and it's so high that people will never increase the price.",,"Let¡¯s talk about the difference with the p40 pro. It feels better when it is lighter, and the battery usage time is basically the same. It feels a little slower to charge with 40W. It may be that the battery is larger, the camera has not been improved, the response speed is faster, and the picture is more realistic, but Still not as good as Apple, but the night scene and vision are better than Apple, the system is still smooth, the difference between 4G and 5G is basically insensitive, only WeChat can feel it when uploading large files",
,"The courier arrived, it was divided",,"I bought a computer on JD.com, and there was no problem, so I trust JD.com. This time I bought a mobile phone for my daughter-in-law.",

For I have never used an Android phone, the only thing I need is to adapt to the Hongmeng system as soon as possible. cheer for huawei",,"1. Through mobile phone cloning, the original ipX address book, pictures/videos were successfully transferred, and the process was very smooth; 2. Since it was the first time to use an Android phone (the usage of Hongmeng system is basically compatible with Android system), it is very Not used to it, all functions need to be re-learned, mainly with the help of online help; 3. The mobile phone signal is much better than the original ipX, whether it is mobile or wireless; 4. After copying the music on the computer to the Music directory of the mobile phone, The song name or singer name displayed by Huawei Music is partly garbled and cannot be recognized, but the music is playing normally, which is a small defect. I hope it can be improved as soon as possible! The current experience of using it for a day is as described above. There are joys and sorrows.",

,"After a year, I started Huawei's flagship again. Although it is a Hongmeng system, the experience is not much different from that of Android. Compared with other brands of Android flagships and the main iPhone 12 that were temporarily overdone before, the biggest advantage is the signal, heat control, photography and battery life, and there is no longer signal anxiety. The appearance design is more recognizable, and the size is moderate and has a good grip. If you don't need 5g, this should be the best choice.",,"Calling is a problem, the voice control is not good, and the privacy is not good, just like the public broadcast. The external sound has always been a shortcoming of Huawei, or is it normal?",
,"Jingdong's self-operated delivery is too fast. Like it, the mobile phone feels smoother and better than the p40",,Batteries get hot,
,"Great, Huawei, really, I locked the screen for a long time and couldn't lock it. It turned out to be face recognition. Huawei mobile phones, Chinese mobile phones, are amazing.

," Coco tea gold, this look is exquisite, it can be said that it is the best P series in all dynasties, and it feels very good, although it is still a bit large, I am very satisfied!

Why is it not as high-end and small as the iphone?",
,"Get started, still not used to it",,"The screen is bright, but it's still not very smooth to play",
,"Huawei p50pro has been looking forward to starting it, it is quite amazing after starting, the weight distribution is uneven, in terms of taking pictures, it is not as good as Apple during the day, the running speed is fast, and the factory has a water gel film",,"I took pictures when I bought it back, but the more I used it, the less clear it was. It seemed like there was a layer of fog, and the signal was a little weak. We support Huawei so much, and Huawei can¡¯t produce basically satisfactory works. I¡¯m sorry for the Chinese people.",
,"I don't like curved screens! So I haven't used an Android phone since mate 10. I bought a Xiaomi Mi 10u, the top version, and then I lost 3,000 a month. I changed it to a fruit 12 and I use it now. I feel that Huawei needs me, and I can just convince myself that the curved screen is acceptable. The full price is not without this strength??? Ordered, waited for 5 days or 6 days, I forgot. After tossing for two days after I got it, I bought a film and put it on and felt much more comfortable. I found an account to log in to my cloud space. The things are still there, but there is a space capacity of 165G. I silently feel sorry for a cloud that I paid for in Xiaomi. After a few days, Xiaomi is gone.",,"There are a few uncomfortable points by the way. Fingerprints are not needed during the day, and face unlocking is very easy. When fingerprints are needed at night, the screen will light up fiercely, which is uncomfortable, and the recognition rate is not very high. I don¡¯t look at the camera data, and I don¡¯t usually take pictures, but I often need to send pictures through WeChat. If I take a random shot of 12 and send it out, it will stop clearly. The P50 is almost meaningless. mushy. Others are free",
,"I like this color very much. It feels good in texture and is very easy to use. I am very happy to give it to my girlfriend.

Wait for the 5G version to come out, and then start another one. Support Huawei, support domestic",,"I have to say that this time is really the ceiling of domestic mobile phones. In recent years, I have not used Samsung or Apple, so it is inconvenient to comment on foreign brands.

,"Works well, although no 5G. But still worthy of the flagship",,"I went to after-sales to make up for the broken screen insurance, and then put a rear film. It feels like it's on a higher level",
,"Grab the Huawei P50pro for more than ten days, grab it! But it feels like a trick! Buy a phone without a charger! The reply from the customer service is that Apple does not bring it, and Xiaomi does not bring Huawei without it! A conscientious enterprise should not be like this, a good consumer who does not learn other people's routines! How to support domestic brands like this! Will I buy shoes without shoelaces in the future, buy an electric car without a charger, buy a watch without a bracelet, buy a car without a bracelet, etc.",,"Everyone is asking about the experience of use. I will tell the truth: First of all, the machine is average, and Xiaoyi Xiaoyi calls it ten times and should be called twice. It is really not easy to use! 7488 bought a 4G, but was also covered without a charger. The charger is a necessary accessory for mobile phones; this is like buying a Shuanghongxing Erke without shoelaces and insoles. (Of course, Hongxing Erke is a conscientious enterprise and a good national enterprise, and will not set it up for the common people.) The answer from the customer service consultation is: If Apple does not bring it, Huawei will not bring it. Listening to this, how can I feel that Huawei is broken by Apple! 7488 is not worth it",
,"Received it in the morning, haven't tried the machine yet, I didn't get the cocoa gold on the 18th, the pink is prettier than the actual picture, my wife likes it very much",,I tried the new phone and it didn't disappoint me. The photo is good and the effect is much better than the M30 Pro I am currently using. The system is very smooth and very good. I love it.,
,"The appearance is exquisite and elegant. Although it is 4G, I feel that Huawei is very attentive. I believe that Huawei's fans will not be disappointed. I personally think that the Hongmeng ecosystem created by Huawei will be fully reflected in this series. I hope Huawei can Beyond?, to become the strongest mobile phone on the surface? Appearance: ok Running speed: ok",,"If I can grab it again, I will buy the p50pro, it's really nice",
,"Seeing that everyone is robbing the light of domestic products, I also came to grab one. What do you say? If 100 is a perfect score, I can give at most 80 points. First, let's talk about the account. I bought an xSport before, and when I went to the pollen club to register an account, I logged out halfway through the registration and logged in with ***. As a result, my usual email address was no longer available. If I wanted to log out, I needed a password. , where is the password? Complaint will not go through. I can only change one email. The second problem to complain about smoothness is indeed smoothness, but there are times when I get stuck. In the system settings, I got stuck twice, and I was stuck and didn¡¯t move. After I slid up, it immediately flashed back. Let¡¯s talk about the booting problem again. There is a function here. When the user looks at the screen, the screen that has been closed will open by itself. I have been going to ""Watch the screen on the screen"", and the result is to turn off the ""On-screen display""",,"After chatting with my wife for less than 30 minutes on WeChat video, I started to get hot. hot face",
,"Apart from being expensive, there is nothing wrong with the system. The system is still pretty good. It's very uncomfortable to not get a refund after paying the full amount. Isn't it in stock? I just want to change the configuration.",,"loss! When it was first released, I couldn't grab it. Now not only are there discounts in stock, but the three parties are even 200 cheaper. I thought that in September, more Qualcomm processors would be available. Now, I see that Kirin has a lot of stock in stock. Maybe they can sell them to mate50.",
,"The back cover is really super-feeling, and the texture of the material is superb. Can see color and light",,"Heat and thermal control are awesome. . It has never been hot once used in various scenarios, including the full picture quality of the king. This is a really comfortable experience. The battery life is indeed as strong as the rumors say. Huawei battery life has always been heard, and colleagues around me have also said that it is good. I have to work overtime on Saturday on the 14th. 5. The quality of the screen is really good. I also saw a review that ranked the p50pro at the top of the list. It was really amazing after getting started. However, the initial color tone is warm, and I am very comfortable after setting it to a cool color. 6. I don¡¯t need to say more about fluency, Kirin 9000 plus various god optimizations, it¡¯s cool",
,"One was taken at night without night scenes, and the other was taken in the evening. The pixels are very good, and the color rendering is also good. After robbing several places for a long time, I didn't expect it. I didn't expect that Jingdong was very happy to grab it, and the phone looks very good. . I just don't have a charger and earphones, but it doesn't affect it. I used Huawei before, and I didn't get 40, so I bought 50. I didn't expect the camera function to be so powerful. I have been using Huawei since I was in college. Apple's mobile phone signal and battery life are not good, and Android phones are not as smooth as Hongmeng system. After using Huawei, I don't want to use other mobile phones.",,"After using the phone for so long, let me tell you how I feel, it is very smooth, smoother than my mate30 5g, and it is really good to take pictures, but the 4g network occasionally delays in the bedroom and cannot be swiped. The network speed with 5g chip is fast, and the sound quality is better than mate30. If you don't mind 4g and want to take good pictures, this phone is currently the best. If you say that the overall aspect is better, you should buy the mate40pro5g, but my sister's mate40pro is not as thin and light as mine, and it looks better in terms of appearance. It should be more suitable for girls. This also depends on everyone's needs for mobile phones. The mate series Higher-end, but this phone is newer, 100 times the pixels are really good, and the screen is well optimized. According to other people's methods, it is indeed a little green when viewed diagonally, but it is not obvious.",
,"First of all, let¡¯s talk about the power of this platform. I don¡¯t know the reason. The official website didn¡¯t grab it, but the platform was lucky enough to grab it. This point must give the owner (JD) a big praise. The platform is powerful, the logistics is powerful, and the key festival node It was raining heavily and the little brother was delivered as scheduled. This point must be praised again and again by the owner and the owner's courier brother, very impressive! ! Then let's talk about the machine: 1. As a new flagship machine, whether it is core or technological, I'm sorry, but I can only say that it is quite satisfactory, which is in line with the normal strength of the HW family, but seriously, the point of ranting is actually There are still quite a lot. In order to use the new machine and feel the progress of national technology, as a flagship new product, the running memory is really weak (8G)! Although it is not about the bigger the better, as the mainstream of the flagship, it is obvious that this fixed price and this configuration are insufficient. 2. Without 5G, what does it mean? It means that unless 5G is not implemented on a large scale in the future, this flagship new machine can only be reduced to a backup machine. 3. The visual effect of the screen is a bright spot, and the sound effect is really not praised. There is a little noise and a certain PAD Dolby sound effect that cannot reach the price of 2k. 4. I have to complain about this point. It is recommended that people who buy later should buy the package directly. Otherwise, like me, I bought the bare metal version and bought the wireless fast charging separately. I actually found that the bare metal is just logic, and the fast charging is just fast charging, no The charging cable, let alone the charging head, if I don¡¯t buy the original one occasionally shows a mismatch, and the original one is out of stock for a long time, then I buy a mobile phone, buy a wireless charger, there is no cable, what am I charging? For the perfect player",,"The number of words is limited, so go ahead and talk about it! For players who have perfect requirements, it is recommended to do it all in one step. Don¡¯t buy it separately like me. One mobile phone, one wireless charger, no cable, no charging head, it is not the same brand¡¯s prompt conflict, buy the same The brand is out of stock, crashing! ! ! 5. Continue to talk about the experience of using it. If you don¡¯t play many games, it¡¯s okay. If you are a game player, the problem of heat is very obvious. Clam, WZ/CJ, when you start playing, you will definitely feel the warmth. , The most obvious heating part is next to the camera. I don't know if there will be any wear and tear after a long time. Photo software, video software, movie software, the phenomenon of heating is still very obvious. Gotta get the time under control. 6. Taking pictures, the P series are all advertised with the camera as the core. How to evaluate it? It can only be said that the quality is acceptable under the premise that the light must be sufficient (nonsense, other old machines can be done outdoors when the weather is good. To), if players have high-end requirements for photography, it is recommended to consider starting after experiencing it, otherwise, whether it is self-portrait or outdoor shooting, it may not be able to achieve the positioning convincing of the ideal flagship. 7. Finally, let¡¯s talk about the battery life, this battery, this configuration, the new phone, if you still use a lot in less than a day, you will find that this battery is more power-down than my old mobile phone, Just look for a quick charge. Overall summary, the platform is powerful, but the new products that come out, depending on how you look at them, choose according to your needs, and consume rationally. Of course, it is also a good experience to buy grass that you like to grow.",
,"As always, the excellent hand feel and camera experience, the cocoa tea gold color matching is a bit like the brown gold mocha gold color matching of the previous mate series. To be honest, many people who buy a 7500 mobile phone without 5G this year must say that they are brainstormed. It depends on what you think. Now, for those who fancy the effect of taking pictures, it is equivalent to buying a camera and giving a 4G mobile phone by the way. For the P40 series, the resolution and white balance of the camera have improved a lot, as well as the focusing speed. Computational photography, which Huawei vigorously promotes, also plays a lot of roles, optimizing the image immediately after the photo is taken.",,"The battery life is comparable to the mate30pro. Combined with 66W super fast charging and the global 90HZ high brush, the experience is good. It is recommended that subsequent mobile phones be made smaller, 6.2 to 6.4 inches.

,"The goods are ok, the logistics is also very good, I also agree that the charger and earphones are not included in the online order, but why did I go to the offline store to buy the charger on August 14, and the salesperson introduced the offline third-party store 6488 to buy a mobile phone and get free value The 279 yuan charger and earphones can't sell the P50? Are online consumers stupid? It's so heartbreaking for you Huawei to do this.",,Too many preset programs on the phone,
,"The original mate20pro has been two and a half years old, and the system is obviously stuck, so I changed my phone.

When I used the M40pro before, there was indeed a green phenomenon, and it was more serious. I hope it can be corrected better this time. By the way, I expect a new wide angle. For people who often shoot customer sites, it is really very practical.

,"Reason for replacement: I have been using iphone in the past four or five years, and currently I use 12mini. I like this compact size very much, but the pain point is poor battery life and poor signal. It is almost equal to disconnection in the bathroom of the unit, which greatly affects my paid shit. experience. So I thought of replacing Android phones, and because Huawei's mobile phone signal is a recognized advantage, and I don't like machines with too much curvature, I found this machine. Talk about the advantages: signal, charging speed, battery life, and taking pictures. These points are all advantages compared to the iphone. By the way, I also think the price of this phone is a bit high, but the reason why I chose it is because I compared the 12pro and I still think this phone is more affordable (I am currently still Then use 4g package), and better solve my pain point needs, after all, 12pro charging and signal are no different from other apples. Let¡¯s talk about some disadvantages: the screen looks good, but it is not as comfortable as Apple¡¯s, and it is still obviously green when you look at it diagonally. The second is that I purchased a wireless charging package. When I use the 66w charging head, it can display 66w super fast charging, but when I use the 50w wireless base, it does not display the words 50w super fast charging. I am very confused whether it is 50w wireless fast charging. Level. Finally, I want to say that the price is not low, even if there is no 5g, it is a bit too much not to give the charger",,"want to give a serious bad review now, the purpose is to complain, p50pro, I bought a mobile phone after buying a 66w fast charge and 50w wireless charging package, but after testing, this super fast charge is not super at all, almost Only 1% speed in 1 minute, and it takes more than an hour to fully charge. Compared with the online evaluation of Huawei mate40pro, it is 75% in 30 minutes, and it can be fully charged in more than 50 minutes. The difference between cloud and mud is the same. I have searched online, and the same is true for others.

Now, for those who fancy the effect of taking pictures, it is equivalent to buying a camera and giving a 4G mobile phone by the way.

,"First of all, let¡¯s talk about the power of this platform. I don¡¯t know the reason. The official website didn¡¯t grab it, but the platform was lucky enough to grab it. This point must give the owner (JD) a big praise. The platform is powerful, the logistics is powerful, and the key festival node It was raining heavily and the little brother was delivered as scheduled. This point must be praised again and again by the owner and the owner's courier brother, very impressive! ! Then let's talk about the machine: 1. As a new flagship machine, whether it is core or technological, I'm sorry, but I can only say that it is quite satisfactory, which is in line with the normal strength of the HW family, but seriously, the point of ranting is actually There are still quite a lot. In order to use the new machine and feel the progress of national technology, as a flagship new product, the running memory is really weak (8G)! Although it is not about the bigger the better, as the mainstream of the flagship, it is obvious that this fixed price and this configuration are insufficient. 2. Without 5G, what does it mean? It means that unless 5G is not implemented on a large scale in the future, this flagship new machine can only be reduced to a backup machine. 3. The visual effect of the screen is a bright spot, and the sound effect is really not praised. There is a little noise and a certain PAD Dolby sound effect that cannot reach the price of 2k. 4. I have to complain about this point. It is recommended that people who buy later should buy the package directly. Otherwise, like me, I bought the bare metal version and bought the wireless fast charging separately. I actually found that the bare metal is just logic, and the fast charging is just fast charging, no The charging cable, let alone the charging head, if I don¡¯t buy the original one occasionally shows a mismatch, and the original one is out of stock for a long time, then I buy a mobile phone, buy a wireless charger, there is no cable, what am I charging? For the perfect player",,"The number of words is limited, so go ahead and talk about it! For players who have perfect requirements, it is recommended to do it all in one step. Don¡¯t buy it separately like me. One mobile phone, one wireless charger, no cable, no charging head, it is not the same brand¡¯s prompt conflict, buy the same The brand is out of stock, crashing! ! ! 5. Continue to talk about the experience of using it. If you don¡¯t play many games, it¡¯s okay. If you are a game player, the problem of heat is very obvious. Clam, WZ/CJ, when you start playing, you will definitely feel the warmth. , The most obvious heating part is next to the camera. I don't know if there will be any wear and tear after a long time. Photo software, video software, movie software, the phenomenon of heating is still very obvious. Gotta get the time under control. 6. Taking pictures, the P series are all advertised with the camera as the core. How to evaluate it? It can only be said that the quality is acceptable under the premise that the light must be sufficient (nonsense, other old machines can be done outdoors when the weather is good. To), if players have high-end requirements for photography, it is recommended to consider starting after experiencing it, otherwise, whether it is self-portrait or outdoor shooting, it may not be able to achieve the positioning convincing of the ideal flagship. 7. Finally, let¡¯s talk about the battery life, this battery, this configuration, the new phone, if you still use a lot in less than a day, you will find that this battery is more power-down than my old mobile phone, Just look for a quick charge. Overall summary, the platform is powerful, but the new products that come out, depending on how you look at them, choose according to your needs, and consume rationally. Of course, it is also a good experience to buy grass that you like to grow.",

I just want to change the configuration.",,"loss! When it was first released, I couldn't grab it. Now not only are there discounts in stock, but the three parties are even 200 cheaper.

,"Seeing that everyone is robbing the light of domestic products, I also came to grab one. What do you say? If 100 is a perfect score, I can give at most 80 points.

As a result, my usual email address was no longer available. If I wanted to log out, I needed a password. , where is the password? Complaint will not go through. I can only change one email. The second problem to complain about smoothness is indeed smoothness, but there are times when I get stuck. In the system settings, I got stuck twice, and I was stuck and didn¡¯t move. After I slid up, it immediately flashed back. Let¡¯s talk about the booting problem again. There is a function here. When the user looks at the screen, the screen that has been closed will open by itself. I've been going to ""Watch the screen on the screen"", and the result is to turn off the ""On-screen display"".",,"After chatting with my wife for less than 30 minutes on WeChat video, I started to get hot. hot face",

," Jingdong's self-operated products are as trustworthy as ever! The video and pictures were originally taken, but the mobile phone was used for poverty alleviation. Buy one and lose the other, the world is such a coincidence haha Appearance: I liked it for a long time, and I bought it for the front and rear screens. I dare not say that I am patriotic, and I dare not say that I support Huawei. Come on, come on, Huawei, come on, screen sound effects: Everyone who starts knows the camera effect: Everyone who starts knows running speed: Everyone who starts knows Standby time: everyone who starts knows other features: Are there any special features? I don't know if that girl next door looks at me with special color",,"This is the effect, the hand shake is shot. The customer service is really patient and the courier is also very hard. Satisfied in every way. Come on for the motherland, come on for Huawei, come on for the middle-aged me",

The price is too expensive",,"Sorry, I wrote the wrong review, I wanted to write a phone case that I bought separately. Huawei P50pro is very easy to use, it is still in the groping stage for the time being, but I don't know why, I always feel that the system is not as smooth as the mate pro series",

From 9:00 am to 12:00 noon, the battery is only 50 , until three or four o'clock in the afternoon, there is no electricity, and it is almost like this for a few days. So I also checked the battery capacity, which is 160mAh higher than the P30pro. The P30pro I have used for three years can last a day anyway. In addition, the screen sensitivity is also poor, the fingerprint recognition is not sensitive, and the memory has not been upgraded. Just like the previous use of the P30pro, you need to use the mobile phone assistant to clean up the memory before continuing! So I am a little disappointed with the P50pro. I feel that the P50pro is worse than the P30pro. No surprises, no new ideas! A failure",,"And the photo effect is also very poor, no matter what mode the photo is taken with, the picture effect is relatively fake",

First of all, I declare that I am a staunch patriotic leader, and I have always sincerely supported domestic products, but my mobile phone experience is very poor. Would never give 4 stars if it was late. Not to mention that the curved screen looks much narrower than the straight screen of the same size for the time being. The curved parts on both sides are a waste of size. After registering for a HUAWEI ID, no matter what, you can't register. Every time you get stuck in the password, the settings are clearly in line with the requirements. , the next step is to not show valid. Also, there is no otg switch, and you have to buy another otg data cable to use USB, which is worse than the OPPO r11 that I plan to eliminate! There are also earphones that must be specially made. If you want to use universal earphones, you have to buy another adapter! Then, after opening the audio file on WeChat, I couldn't find the player or switch anymore. I couldn't even use the housekeeper to clean it up. I didn't buy Apple before, but I only supported the domestic brand. ! ! Why so rubbish? ! How much water is there in those blindly good comments? !

First of all, the boot is very slow, and the fingerprint needs to be recognized many times before it can be opened. Secondly, the curved screen is very insensitive, and sometimes it takes several times. After a few days, I bought a machine for more than 6,000 yuan as a backup machine. If I didn¡¯t play big games, I just played an ant manor star and the planet was stuck. I was angry and funny. Just use WeChat and Weibo, there is almost no memory, and now every morning when I wake up, my mobile phone can't wake up like a cerebral thrombosis. My iPhone 6 is the main camera. It's been very smooth for so many years. It can't compare with the old iPhone. I'm so sad. Those who ran to support domestic products let their feelings be unrestrained, but the feelings were tragic. What I told me after the sale was also irritating. It made me restart two or three times a month, and I was very unhappy. I didn¡¯t buy a mechanical watch, and I had to wind it up. I never restarted my iPhone 6. They asked me to back up and restore the settings, but I couldn't accept it, so I only bought it for a month! If so, who would buy it? I plan to retire if I can.

I snapped up on the 1st and received it on Double Eleven. It was much faster than expected, and the screen felt good. It took me several generations to change from mate9 to mate40Pro. I can only say that Huawei mobile phones are too old. My family, young and old, have been fooled into pollen by me, and everyone has a Huawei.

The configuration of the 40pro in all aspects is the king's bomb, especially attracted by the body sensation. The only thing is that the color matching of the 30 is better than the 40. The 4 colors are a bit mature, and some clear and cute ones can be produced, which are more suitable for women. Children's colors.",,China is promising! ! Victory! !,

I have used ipone6SP for so many years before, and the video is not as hot as this while charging, and I am worried about safety issues.

The mate series is indeed Huawei's most high-end flagship mobile phone!",,"Many people are concerned about the problem of the screen. They took a picture with a magnifying glass. After looking for a long time, they could not see whether it was Zhou Dongyu arranged. Please help me to see. Welcome to leave a message",

,"The overall is quite satisfactory, the system is smooth, and the screen is good. The biggest advantage is the battery life. Light users can use it for a whole day. With super fast charging, it only takes half an hour to charge a day. Of course, there are also shortcomings, that is, taking pictures, not forcibly black, but whether photography or videography, it is really not good, maybe only 40pro+ will be better.",,"After using it for a while, the overall feeling is ok. First of all, let¡¯s talk about the advantages. The battery life is really good. With the 66W fast charge, you don¡¯t have to worry about the problem of insufficient power. Although the camera is worse than the IPHONE12, it is quite stable compared to other mobile phones, at least worthy of the price. The fluency on the system is very good, and there has been no software flashback card* problem. However, there are also some shortcomings. The first one is that there are many system bugs. Obviously, the alarm clock is set, but there will be a problem that it does not ring on a regular basis. Obviously, there is a WeChat payment** shortcut on the desktop, but the payment code cannot be jumped out when I click it. I have no choice but to ask the customer service, and I can't give any solution. In addition, the humanization of the system also needs to be strengthened, such as the quick switch between ringing and silent mode like the iPhone. I hope Huawei will improve it in the follow-up update.",
,"I was puzzled, and I asked if the exchange has anything to do with confidential information? It's disgusting to sell different screens for the same price",,"As soon as Huawei reaches the light green, you panic and plan to buy another Apple. The mobile phone search for new Android software is really disgusting. You don't know what software is matched by default. There are so many downloads, and you can't recommend the ones with the exact same name. Personally, I don¡¯t think there are as many mobile widgets as the iPhone. Take WPS as an example. It stands to reason that widgets should be a feature of Android. And I only ran about 440,000 running points, so I don't understand it very well. Don't bully me, bullshit is also my right.",
,"I got Zhou Dongyuping, there is no comparison, I think it's okay",,"It's been used for a few days, and the charging is really fast, but the power is quite drained. Just reading the news, WeChat, and QQ can't last all day, and the red line is at six or seven o'clock.",
,Very useful recommendation,,"Not bad, really fragrant, but the Android phone camera is still average",
,"After watching the press conference, I found that the whole is very strong and I want to start. The bleach looks very beautiful and has a high appearance, especially the white color. It feels very silky, the standby time is long, the charging is very fast, and the photo effect is very good, clear and high in pixels. , There is no pressure in playing games and watching videos. It is worthy of Kirin 9000. I am optimistic about this magic machine. Seller shipped fast and well packaged. Old users support you!",,I have been using this machine for a few days and it is very easy to use. It is definitely a must-have machine of choice.,
,"Other features: It's all good, but it's hard to get it. The price isn't its fault, it's mine. . Photo effect: The photo effect is really good, especially in the night scene mode. All kinds of applications are displayed in seconds: it should be the star screen that everyone said, no matter which arrangement of such a high resolution, the display effect is very good, no need to tangle. When the curved surface is facing the front, the light refraction will turn a little green, which is somewhat related to the ambient light and the brightness of the screen. It is acceptable. It seems that some people say that LG's is gray.",,"The noise reduction is really great. It's too noisy to hear a phone call in the hotel. When I go back to listen to the call recording, there is no noise at all, just like in the room. This is awesome.",
,"didn¡¯t take any pictures, so I¡¯ll save a few other buyer¡¯s shows for everyone to see the colors. Tell me about my experience. After waiting for 10 days, I finally received my anxious heart. I have not used an Android phone for many years. , I used Samsung's S6 or something in 2015 before. I remember using it very badly. Since then I switched to the iPhone system and I have always been a little biased against Android. I feel that Android is bundled with some bad software, and the software that cannot be deleted is automatically deleted. The installed software, but many of my friends and colleagues around me have used Android in the past two years. I still feel that Android is very stuck and the system is very watery. Alas, the frog at the bottom of the well haha MATE40PRO really surprised me, the screen display is very good, and the pixels are also high, And the main reason is that the system as a whole makes me feel amazing. I also solidified and stayed on the experience in 2015. I didn¡¯t expect it to be so smooth. I like it very much. There are two reasons for buying this phone. First, Apple¡¯s system is boring. There is really no innovation and breakthrough point. Second, buying Huawei is also a kind of support for domestic production. I am very satisfied that it has changed my knowledge. Very good, I should support Huawei more in the future, very satisfied",,"Although buying a mobile phone is not completely up to the level of patriotism in my opinion, I think it is all in the mobile phone industry. Whoever does a good job will have customers and attract people. Apple really does not use it. After a few years, I felt that the system was tired, and there was no innovation, so I tried Huawei. It turns out that I experienced it too late. I am really a frog in the bottom of the well.",
,"It is indeed possible, I love it, I will buy it from Huawei next time, and I will never get lost again.",,"Very easy to use, really fast, satisfied",
,"7 years of pollen has hurt Huawei. I bought the mate40Pro, but the screen is still the same as BOE, Samsung, LG, and the lottery? Unfortunately, I got BOE, a mobile phone with a price, and people who are green in BOE are uncomfortable, but the experience store is not so obvious, I wasted so much time to grab it! Forget it, it is estimated to be the last Huawei before Huawei is strong!",,"On the whole, except for the screen that is extremely unsatisfactory, all other aspects meet personal needs, and there are certain surprises, so let's slowly support Huawei.",
,"Grab it on Double Eleven, it runs smoothly and charges fast. Except that it is a little uncomfortable for this curved screen, everything else is very good",,Good looks. Double Eleven was quickly grabbed by hand. happy. It runs smoothly and has powerful camera functions.,
,"Received on the 11th, arrived on the 15th, the logistics is fast, to force",,"It has been used for many days, and it runs very smoothly, hahaha, it is perfect to use",
,"Zero payment, logistics took five days to receive, speechless. I have used it for a while to evaluate it, it is quite smooth to use, and it is really good for night shots, but the phone case with light is too expensive, and there are few goods, so I don¡¯t plan to buy it. There are too few good-looking suitable phone cases on the market. Can someone help me see the screen arrangement I don't understand",,"The mobile phone has been used for almost a month, and I carefully checked that the screen is a diamond, it is still very easy to use, and it is relatively smooth. The phone case is still really fragrant. I bought it. White and white look so good.. It's not bad to use. It can be used for occasional photos.",
,"The edge of the screen is slightly green. Other problems are not big, but if you usually use 5G and 90 to refresh, you may have to charge twice a day, which is still a bit fast (the student party may be more), but it is very fast to charge 20 to 100 for half an hour. Basically full, overall very satisfied",,I wonder if everyone's inside will have such a non-fitting and prying look?,
,"I grabbed it on Double Eleven and received it on 11.13. I don't know what screen it is. Anyway, it looks very delicate and runs fast. My husband doesn't get stuck using it to eat chicken. The camera effect is okay. I used a Honor mobile phone before, and the battery life doesn't feel much improved than before. ,very satisfied",,"There are many gods who understand, please show what kind of prize this screen is.",
,"I dragged a friend to buy it in the physical store and couldn't buy it, but finally I grabbed it on the official website. Very happy, it works well, runs very fast, and charges very quickly. New functions are being developed. Girls use it well, except that it is a little big and a little heavy. It supports domestic production.",,Please take a look at this is Zhou Dongyu?,
,"bought it on Double Eleven. After a long wait of seven days, it finally arrived today. It¡¯s very good. The fruit fans turned around and saw the strength of Huawei.

First of all, let's talk about the system: smooth, very flexible, not stuck... Voice assistant: Xiaoyi is so good, it makes my Guangpu even better??, even if it's not very standard Transform what I want to express ??. I don't know what to say, but I really hate the book when it's time to use it! If you have anything you want to ask or understand, you can leave a message and I will answer the question truthfully",

,"The screen is large, the charging is fast, the phone is a bit thick, and it runs at 87w. Generally speaking, it may be that the release is too rushed, and the system is not optimized. Okay, there is a small problem, the workmanship is still very good, and I hope that some small bugs will be solved later. Good photo effect: much better than mate30pro Battery life: charging super fast Running speed: the strongest in China, but not more than 865 full blood version",,"I am very satisfied with the after-sales service, but the professional knowledge of customer service needs to be enhanced. Hope to strengthen professional knowledge.",
,"No one can put out the stars in the sky! ! ! I couldn¡¯t get it for the first launch, and I¡¯ve been paying attention to it in the follow-up. I didn¡¯t get the Mate 40 Pro Glaze White 256GB until the 0:00 release on November 1st. Thank you Tmall for torturing my patience. Also thank the customer service for the stereotyped reply in one word: wait! During this period, there are also many small partners who are eager to get refunds and choose other brands. Those who have not grabbed them or want to wait for next year can choose V40Pro. In fact, when I received the goods, I realized that sticking to my choice was not a difficult thing to endure, and I felt that the 20 days were not in vain. Using feeling: The first feeling is amazing, it is the kind of pure white, like ceramic, the fingerprint after use is not obvious, the grip is very good, the weight of the mobile phone feels very fit on my hand, I don't think the 220G mobile phone is very good. Shen. Those who are more daring and not too troublesome can use it with bare metal. The workmanship is excellent, the red switch key is very eye-catching, the most important point, I like Huawei very much! Do not! ring! Save! (manual dog head). Compared with the previous generation flagship, the biggest improvement of the Mate 40 Pro should be the new 5G SoC, quasi-2K 90Hz screen, 66W wired/50W wireless charging power, and dual speakers. There is no improvement in camera hardware, but it still tops DXOMARK with better algorithms. Needless to say, the performance of Kirin 9000 is comparable to that of A14.",,"The screen comprehensively considers the resolution, refresh rate and battery life, and the color accuracy compared with the computer is also very good. Screen: In fact, the difference between the screen depends on the user's mentality. As long as you don't look at the screen with a microscope, how big is the difference? Besides, isn't the main purpose of buying a mobile phone to get the latest and best experience? Do you keep looking at the mobile phone? It doesn't matter which supplier's screen it is and what arrangement it is, won't Huawei screen it? He wouldn't dare to use a substandard/inferior screen. It would be nice if it could be used normally. I hope that more domestic products can be like Huawei. ""Together, you can!""",
,"The white model was ordered on the 1st of January, and it took 16 days for delivery. I was really tired of waiting. Mine is Zhou Dongyu¡¯s screen. Personally, it doesn¡¯t matter. Others feel good.

Shipping took a while.",,"Invoices are delayed. Really fire. Don't promise what you can't do. The official answer from the customer service is really tired of listening. Huawei, hehe",
,hope I can help Huawei out of difficulties as soon as possible. Other features: Starlink is stronger than Oreo. Photo effect: I feel a little stronger than p40.

It's not good at all, don't buy it, it might be easier for me to buy another one",,"The customer service called me as soon as I evaluated it, thinking that the harassing call was not answered. Huawei is still very concerned about the user experience. I like the phone so much, I want to grab another one. It's not easy to use, it's a joke, I'm a friendly army",
,"The green edge is very serious, but the accessories have been opened for use and cannot be returned, so I am disappointed",,obvious in white,
,"The phone itself is pretty good. This time, Dongyu Zhou's screen was drawn in the lottery, and the color is still yellowish overall. The delivery was sparse, and the full amount was photographed in the early morning of the 1st. I feel that it was photographed by the first few people, and it was not shipped until the evening of the 16th. Taobao official group, the post bar saw that the same model at the same time or later than me has the phenomenon of shipping earlier than me, consulted the customer service and said it was a warehouse problem. There is still no delivery in the group, and the process of waiting is really speechless. 2 stars for encouragement.",,"I made some complaints and said some advantages. Compared with my previous fruit machine, it is basically full at 80% in half an hour and an hour. Nice photo. The two sides of the star screen are indeed green, but the flaws do not hide the good. The battery life is not as good as expected, but the charging is fast, and the basic problem is not big.",
,"Huawei mobile phones are good or not, but the screen has a lottery and it is very uncomfortable. Can't a big company use the same screen? Or you are short of this money, I will get a 256 in white and I will get Zhou Dongyu's arrangement, and I will also take it, especially if I bought it together with a friend, both of which are the same color and memory, his is no problem, which makes I feel unbalanced in my heart and feel very uncomfortable. The screen look and feel is different. I'm really convinced. This is the second time I buy Huawei products, and it may be the last time. Is your last product of this quality? But there is really no way. After goodbye, I will not buy Huawei's mobile phones again, unless you really correct it, and I heard that the screen may really be all arranged by Zhou Dongyu in the future, here for future brothers. A reminder, the screen look and feel is really bad, please think twice when buying",,"I rarely give bad reviews to products. It can be said that this is the first time. To be honest, I really can¡¯t stand it anymore. I really despise this kind of behavior. on the screen",
,"Other features: Zhou Dongyu, Zhou Dongyu, Zhou Dongyu, a good mobile phone is really ruined by the screen, what can I say, the screen is really rubbish, not ordinary rubbish, I will be laughed at when I take it out, I can't change my hands if I want to. Lost photo effect: It's ok to take pictures, but the green screen is very uncomfortable. If you haven't bought it, it's not recommended to buy Battery life: It takes a long time to charge the battery. Although the charging is fast, the heat is serious. Communication sound quality: No card is inserted. Think about something that costs nearly 7,000 yuan, and it¡¯s still a domestic phone. With such a low-end screen, who can do better? You can¡¯t accept it if you buy it. Comments on how many people bought the green screen. Originally, I thought this phone would be very good after watching the press conference. Yes, in fact, the operation speed of the hand is completely different: it is no different from the previous generations. Display effect: very poor, Zhou Dongyu, some people buy masonry screens at the same price, but mine is particularly serious, the whole screen glows green, The green on the curved surface is more serious, and it hurts the eyes. After using it for a long time, the eyes hurt badly. It is really not a black Huawei. The mate20 I used before is better than the screen of this generation.",,"Seriously cut corners, I suggest you go to a physical store to experience the green edge before deciding to buy it. It really affects your eyes. After watching it for a long time, you will feel a tingling feeling. Then about after-sales, it is useless for you to find him. They are all robots. , I bought Huawei because of my patriotism. If you get the same mobile phone as me, I suggest you to find more after-sales chat, although I know it is useless, but there are so many people in China, if it is this kind of green border, you should accept it. If you can't accept it, you must let them know, otherwise the product will not improve, and I will continue to contact the official after-sales phone number. So expensive mobile phones always have to give an explanation, right?",
,Very green on both sides,,very serious on both sides,
,"The screen still has a lottery. If you are lucky, the BOE will turn green on both sides. The phone will not be refunded if you use it. It will be shipped in 4 days. The disadvantage is that there is a jack for headphones and charging. Bad, the earphones don't need to be sent directly",,"Fast charging, long standby time, green on both sides, dark mode, Kirin 9000 for gaming",
,"have always used Huawei, and the products are better from generation to generation",,Huawei's operation is really rude,
,"One star for the marketing of the monkey, deliberately suppressing the goods, waiting for ten days to ship the payment, or scolding the customer service before sending it. In the past two years, the Honor magic2 did the same, and if it was in stock, it would not be released. Most of the replenishment is to replenish 1 piece of inventory, which shows that the inventory is tight and the supply of artificial manufacturing is tight. The other one star gave the screen a lottery, and they were all the same price. Why did they give me Zhou Dongyu ?? After using it for a few days, the power consumption was quite heavy, and I had to charge it twice a day... After all, 5G consumes power... Understandable... 66W fast charging in disguise makes up for the heavy power consumption Shortcomings¡­",,There is also a small detail. I got this one out of the box and it was completely out of power. It took a few minutes to turn on the charger after plugging in the charger. Does it prove that the stock has been in stock for a long time?,
,"The standard transparent phone case is easy to put on, but not easy to remove. The phone responds very quickly, but there is no photography course, so I am not particularly good at taking pictures. The charging speed is very fast, which is good",,"The running speed is very fast, and the photos and videos are very clear. Now I feel that my mobile phone is similar to a computer. It can complete a lot of work. Sending product photos to customers is fast and high-definition. It is very suitable for office work. It charges very quickly. Enough for one day.",
,"Give one point to the customer service (after all, she can't do anything about it), I have always used Huawei, but this time the screen mixed use was met; I bought it and used it for the third day. First of all, I didn't announce the fact that the screen was mixed in advance. I also bought it, and secondly, Zhou Dongyu's screen experience is really not as good as other screens (although the official has repeatedly emphasized how to detect all the screens, how to ensure the same quality and give a tone adjustment plan) , and finally, claim that all screens are the same, but secretly use 100% diamond arrangement for Porsche and pro+. To deceive others, you must deceive yourself first, right? I don't believe it myself. The patriotic leek box is fragrant and I'm happy to be cut, but what is the operation of this same flower ?? to send out different goods? above",,sorry sorry sorry for typo,

Taking pictures: no optical image stabilization, very stable, very pleasant Charging: very happy very soon Appearance: white is really beautiful, love",,"Today, I went to the store to compare the display machines and found that my screen is much brighter than the display machine in the store. Whether it is the Porsche version of the drill screen or the pro's Zhou Dongyu screen, I don't know if the display machine in the store is not very good. , a little happy anyway",
,"Grab two sets, the later the more difficult to grab, bright black delivery is fast, green plain leather, grabbed before Double 11, double 11 paid the balance, but it has not yet shipped, and some grabbed on the 12th It's shipped, I don't know what the delivery mechanism is, random or according to mood? Also, the full praise in the comment area is indeed a bit fake. One thing to say is that the mobile phone is a good mobile phone, but there is no need to kidnap patriotic feelings. Those who use Apple are not necessarily unpatriotic, and those who use Huawei are not necessarily patriotic. There is nothing wrong with supporting domestic products, but don't make us sad. One last word, Huawei Niubi, Trump*",,"There is also one that was grabbed on the 11.6th, but it has not been shipped. It is understandable that it is out of stock. Then why do you have to buy it every day? And only a few units are released at a time, and they will not be shipped if they are grabbed. If they are out of stock, don¡¯t put them out for panic buying. If they are out of stock, they should be shipped normally, playing tricks on consumers, and very few goods are released every day. This feeling has been worn away by your marketing methods. I used to have a good impression of Huawei, but now I can only laugh.",

After setting it up, restart the machine and it will be gone.",,This is the screen setting. Huawei mobile phones are all default settings at the factory. You can change it yourself.

,"have never used a Huawei mobile phone, and I grabbed this phone for several days in order to support Huawei. 1. It is understandable that Android and iOS are still very different in use. 2Huawei's camera is amazing, beyond your image. But videos, especially portraits, are completely distorted. 3. The battery is not as good as it is said to be. If I go out at nine o'clock in the morning, it will not work at four or five in the afternoon. I'm a little disappointed. I used it normally and didn't overuse it. I still didn't dare to play casually after changing the phone. But fast charging is really fast. 4. The signal is really good. 5. The curved screen is very tasteless, and the curved surfaces on both sides affect the visual effect and touch effect. 6. The biggest problem is the screen. The color change is obvious when the screen angle changes slightly, and the screen is yellowish when it is adjusted to the coldest, which affects the visual perception. The staff in the Huawei customer service store just look at it with the naked eye without doing any testing. The feedback to me said that this is normal imagination, and Huawei's telephone customer service also said that it is normal imagination. Have you started talking nonsense with your eyes open? Is this how you deal with your supporters perfunctorily? To sum up, it is the first time to use a Huawei mobile phone, and it is also the last time. Huawei's quality control is far from the flagship. I used to blame everyone for going to the fruit store and not supporting domestic production. After I used it myself, it was really hard to say. Ugh. It is not recommended to buy, there are many ways to be patriotic.",,"****HUAWEI, the customer service told me to go to the store to do a test and get a test report. I went to the store and the staff said that the mobile phone was not broken and would not be tested. It is really difficult for consumers to protect their rights. Only use this. Spicy chicken quality control. annoyed.",
,"To be honest, this experience was very unsatisfactory. The order was placed on the 3rd, and it was shipped on the 12th. Asking the customer service back and forth was just a few words to prevaricate people. It was finally delivered. The courier actually took eight days. Can you believe it? Really convinced, my roommate bought it a week later than me, but the iPhone 12 shipped on the same day as me, and it arrived in two days, I'm really convinced. As for the phone itself, just mix the screens together, can't you mix some screens of similar quality? You prefer a yin and yang screen. My Zhou Dongyu screen is the same as turning on the eye protection mode when compared with the LG screen. Who can accept the same price but get a different quality product? Finally, I want to say that criticizing Huawei is not the same as being unpatriotic. Please don¡¯t kidnap morality and force the product to be branded as a country. There are indeed many areas in Huawei that need to be improved. As the light of domestic products, you must come up with products that satisfy consumers. . I also wish Huawei to get out of the predicament as soon as possible, to do better and stronger, dream it possible",,"Zhou Dongyu's screen is reluctantly acceptable, but the battery life is indeed broken, at least two charges a day, the phone looks good, but unfortunately the camera does not have anti-shake",

I was originally asking for a pro+ *** either to increase the price or to be unable to grab it. I felt that the pro was okay. Zhou Dongyu's display settings were bright and cool, dark mode, and dimming the brightness was good for the eyes. The resolution is the highest, and the fineness is fine. Maybe I am not so sensitive to the screen. It is recommended to charge the new mobile phone at about 20. Don't play before it is fully charged, so that the battery has a charging memory.

,"The body is very delicate, round, and very friendly to the palm of the hand. It is a boon for heavy mobile phone users. Even if you hold it in your hand for several hours, it will not hurt your hand. Behind the runway-shaped hole on the front of the screen is integrated a lot of black technology. Compared with Apple's big bangs mate40pro's small runway, it integrates more black technology but occupies a smaller screen area, and voice answering calls is also my favorite. Although it is a little more expensive than the Apple 12, the actual experience of Huawei mate40pro makes me very willing to pay for him. The actual use experience is at the top level, so there is no need to compromise for the price, because it is impossible to do a product full of compromises. For the ultimate user experience, I hope Huawei's high-end products can continue to lead their peers. Praise for the wisdom of the Chinese, come on Huawei",,"After frequent and heavy use, it gives the impression that the stability and reliability of the phone's operation are in place, no abnormal conditions are found, the wireless charging speed is very fast, and the safety is guaranteed.

I hope Huawei can continue to have such a positive attitude and make good products, thank you",

It took a few days to experience the phone before I got started.",,"After a few days of experience, it is true that the power consumption is a bit fast as stated on the Internet. Compared with my last Honor mobile phone, it feels good in the hand, and it is ok to play games. On the whole, I am not satisfied with the standard, and the comprehensive evaluation is out of 10. I can give it 8.5 points. The deducted 1.5 points is that the standby power consumption really needs to be improved. There is also a feeling that the volume of the dual speakers is asymmetrical. Accept, I am looking forward to the Hongmeng system, I hope the growth of Hongmeng will not let me down, but I don't know when the next time I change to a Huawei phone.",

However, this screen display is really too general, and it is the only thing that makes me hesitate to return it. Compared with my last mobile phone, vivo xplay6, the difference in display color, fineness, and clarity is visible to the naked eye. Later, I realized that the old mobile phone has a 2K screen, and the new mobile phone has a 1080P screen. There is still room for improvement in the display color adjustment. Battery life: In normal use, about 60% is used in a day, which is enough for me. Dual speakers: Satisfied with external sound effects. Fluency: Very good. System: Small details are good. Appearance: I quite like it. Disadvantages: The overall cost performance is average, or the premium is more. Phones these days are big, thick and heavy, and it feels like a decade ago. In the end, I hesitated for a week, considering whether to wait for vivo X60, thinking about it is a mobile phone or not tossing, I hope that it will not be stuck in three years",,"The photo is really great, thanks!

The design and feel are really good, and the phone is really heavy, not a little bit heavier than the last one plus 6. There is no doubt that Zhou Dongyu won the lottery, and the edge is green, but it is acceptable that it is not as serious as it is seen on the Internet. My wife's p40 is very smooth to use, so I decided to grab this one. It is indeed used with a high-brush screen to use all kinds of smoothness. Charging is not as fast as expected, and power consumption is not as fast as others say.

,"It took me a few days to comment on it (^-^) First of all, I have to complain about its delivery time. I have been waiting for too long~ I grabbed it at 8:08 pm on 11/1, and 7 pm on 11/18 It will be shipped as soon as eight o'clock. But delivery is very fast. The goods were dispatched on the evening of the 18th and arrived at 8 am on the 19th the next day. But I think it's worth the wait! ! I like it so much~ Running speed: The running speed is very smooth and I am satisfied. Hope to keep this pace. Don't start to freeze the display effect after using it for a year: After buying it, many people have popularized the little yellow duck screen, which makes me a little scared. But I was lucky to get LG's diamond screen. I think it is very clear to use with the naked eye, and I don't think there is any greenishness. Battery life: The battery life I saw someone commented on going for a few days without a charge, I'm still looking forward to it. But to be honest, when I use my phone normally, I still need to charge it at least once a day. But the charging speed is really fast. Photo effect: I don't know how to say this, it's not professional, I'll talk about it from the perspective of ordinary people. Sometimes I feel that the pixel is not very good when it is just viewed on the screen before the camera has captured it. But after it was taken and turned into a photo, it looked good again? I don't understand, the camera can adjust a lot of parameters, so I can't play. The film is sometimes very good, the color is very full and clear. But sometimes it feels very low pixel. I'm confused too, don't know what to do",,"Addition: I came from Apple, and Huawei can also swipe left, right, up and down like Apple to delete the background, which I was used to in the original Apple system. So when I overdo it, there is basically no transition period, and I can get started right away. Then there are some small operating skills that are more suitable for me in the Huawei system. Like split screen. There are also apps such as iQiyi, you can shrink the window and then come out to the home page to play. For Apple, only the web version of iQIYI can, but not the app version. The same is true for other video apps (I know very well, because I was very happy when Apple released this function, but the app does not support it yet.) There are also Huawei's air gestures, many people say it is tasteless, but I am too I like it (^_^)v Because when I read a novel, such as eating, blowing my hair, and letting it turn the pages automatically, sometimes I read a little faster and slower, which would be inconvenient. But I like it when I flip it apart like this~ The gesture is done according to the tutorial. The first gesture should wait until a small hand icon appears on the phone screen before doing the next gesture. I succeed every time",
,"The order placed in the morning of 11.1 will be shipped from Dongguan on the 18th and received on the 19th. The edge of the BOE screen is a bit green, but it is not as exaggerated as some pictures on the Internet. There is no substantial problem with the screen itself, but since it is to be a curved screen, the appearance of the two sides is not clean. It is indeed a technical flaw. After using it for a few days, the battery life has no effect on the new machine. 7p is replaced, the sound quality is not good, other aspects are very delicate, the function is very strong, the operation is very practical, and the photo is really good. To sum up, it's still good, the screen will be better if the screen is improved",,"A follow-up comment, I was thinking of changing my phone this year. I compared the ip12 and mate40.

I'll come up and give a one-star bad review first, because I've waited so long for me The coldness encountered in time finally came to an end. If you buy Huawei's new products again in the future, you should be cautious, and think about buying again. Maybe, should, probably won't buy it again.",,"Today is the third day of trying out the phone. I can only say that I have no regrets when I switched from Apple to Huawei. The reason why I was reluctant to switch at first was that I thought the system might be slow, but in fact there was no situation that I worried about. When I tried the mobile phone yesterday, I already felt that the signal was obviously stronger than that of Apple, and I was very satisfied. The process of playing the machine started today, and it really opened the door to a new world. I actually have no idea about taking pictures, so I can't comment on the camera function. I just bought a Huawei computer a few months ago, and today I want to try the function of collaborative office, really, very unusual! Is it okay to operate the mobile APP directly on the computer? No need to go through other third-party platforms anymore. It can only be said that Huawei has indeed taken the lead in this regard. I probably forgave him because of the anger over the delay in shipping the new phone. If I need to change my phone in the future, I can buy Huawei again. Of course, if I choose to buy the one that is in stock, as long as I don¡¯t go through the silly waiting process, I believe that everyone who changes to Huawei will not regret it.",

I feel that the standby power consumption is a bit high, and the full grid dropped 5% overnight, which is very surprising! The new Apple remembers that it hasn't lost so much.

Such a green screen is a normal effect, so why is it not so green compared to the curved screen mobile phones launched by the same industry?

The photo effect is very good, but the hand is steady, because the main camera does not have OIS. Calls and sound quality are very clear, and the sound quality is not thin. The only regret is the screen. The one I received is the BOE screen, but for daily use, the dark mode doesn't matter, and I don't think it is very green.

As a result, when I went to register on the 3rd, it said it was closed, and it was the 1st. As notified, the deadline is on the 1st. Then why didn't I tell you when I asked on the 2nd? ? ? And it happened to be shipped just before the deadline. It's a coincidence, right? This kind of business is really bullying customers, and it has been reported to Tmall's official customer service. Tmall official said that it is a business behavior. They can't control it. In contrast, the customer service of Huawei Mall is much better, and if there is a problem, it will take the initiative to call back to the customer to follow up the situation. I suggest that you go to Huawei Mall to buy it in the future. The Tmall store is really upgraded, and the service level is too poor.",

,"Grab it at 10:08 am on Double 11, shipped on the 26th, and received it on the morning of the 27th. The delivery is indeed too slow, but Huawei did not disappoint this time. It has been used for 11 days, six years of fruit powder, six years I have also used a Huawei mobile phone before. In the past, I felt that it was not as smooth and smooth as an Apple mobile phone. After a long time, it would become stuck. This year, the Mete40 pro changed my view of domestic mobile phones. The operating system is very close to ios. , and there is nothing unaccustomed to. Display effect: The screen is arranged in Samsung diamonds. Although it does not turn green, there will be gray borders on both sides. This should be a common problem with curved screens. The overall display is warm, a bit like turning on a little anti-blue light. In fact, I didn't feel anything, but it wasn't that dazzling. Photo effect: I don't have the latest iPhone 12, only the xs max. If you compare the two, the photo is slightly stronger than the Apple xs max. Especially at night, the night scene is more powerful and the playability is relatively high, especially when two mobile phones take pictures at the same time. After importing it into the computer, you can really see the difference. The resolution of Apple's display screen is indeed better than that of Huawei's mobile phone, so I always feel that it is not as clear as Apple's when looking at the original mobile phone. Communication quality: The signal is very satisfactory, and the network reception is also relatively good. Battery life: The battery life is not as strong as imagined. Although the battery capacity is large, the power consumption is still very high. The standby power will drop 5% at night. The normal use will be a little more the next day. I hope that the software can be optimized and updated in the future. 66W charging is really fast.

Although the body size is relatively large, it is still very comfortable to hold with one hand. The design of the front pill does not have much impact on the look and feel.

I would like to say a few points today, I hope they are really listening: 1. There are a lot of fancy functions, but they are not practical. A few, such as gestures in the air, I can't think of anything that I need to use, such as watching the bright screen, the accuracy is not high, but it makes people feel that the phone is always watching me silently with the camera on; 2. The system operation is not simple and it is really difficult to use, such as adding a boarding pass, for example, the smart scene card on the left cannot be sorted, such as opening the app lock and reminding every few minutes, obsessive-compulsive disorder is annoying, etc.; 3. Huawei itself There are many applications, but opening each application is full of shopping ads. I thought that adding a membership card function would save me a few cards. I was wrong, he asked me to register a membership card, and even the speaker Xiaoyi popped up from time to time. A few advertisements, mobile phones, speakers, watches, routers, etc. can be replaced by Huawei, and now I think I support him, but he just wants to make money.",

As for this machine. . . I placed an order on Double Eleven, received it on December 9th, and activated it on the 11th. When the screen is turned on, you can see the BOE screen. Before buying it, I went to the experience store several times, and I also brushed a lot at station B, so I was mentally prepared. The display quality is a little bit worse and I accept it. The situation is difficult, and it is also necessary to support domestic suppliers. With the in-depth use, I began to find the problem of display afterimage. At first, I thought it was called screen burn-in. After searching on the Internet, everyone said that screen burn-in was a natural defect of OLED, and there was no solution. So I continued to use it and found this problem in more scenarios. I asked my classmate about the same machine that I ordered on the same day. Fortunately, he has an LG screen. I taught him to test it and found that there is no such problem. Continue to learn online, this is called display afterimage/afterimage. On December 24th, I went to the offline after-sales for testing. The results are as shown in the figure. The after-sales service is very good. Get a new machine on the 26th! I took it back and tested it on the same day, and it still shows afterimages? ! In the after-sales company WeChat response, engineers tested the store prototype, and they all had the same problem. (The store experience machines are undoubtedly 128G BOE screens). On the 27th, I went to the after-sales service again, and told me that if I continued to replace the machine, the result might still be the same, and it was recommended to return it. Unfortunately, after 7 days, Tmall customer service will not refund. The after-sales help called to explain, went back and waited all night, and agreed to return it on the 28th!

,"Let¡¯s start with payment and delivery, payment on 11.11, delivery on 12.08 and delivery on the 9th, this is understandable, because so many people in the country are robbing it, and it looks like Zhou Dongyuping when I receive the goods, I also accept it, who told me to like it. I often watch Douyin. It took me less than half a month, that is, about ten days. When I suddenly launched the interface, I would see the ? plus sign in Douyin. I asked Huawei customer service, and Huawei customer service told me that it was screen burn. , afterimage, I finally accepted that Zhou Dongyu gave me a whole screen burn, and then I asked the customer service of this store, and the customer service gave me a solution, but didn't answer my question, I checked whether the screen burn was It's irreversible, and I don't want to find a way to solve it for me. I have been playing word games for me. I have taken pictures. The customer service told me that I can't see it. I don't know that the customer service is a few hundred degrees of myopia. Then I went to the Huawei after-sales service again. The staff asked me any questions, and then checked my activation date and suggested me to replace it with a new phone. After three days of waiting, I was notified to pick up the phone. I will never buy it in this store again, just go directly. Official grab, more reliable",,"took it very clearly on my mobile phone, and I couldn¡¯t see it when I posted it in the comments. I don¡¯t know if everyone¡¯s mobile phone has this problem.

I didn't take it seriously. I thought it was my own illusion. I thought that it was a 5nm chip or a flagship machine. After a few years, I still believe in Huawei.

Moderate use, battery life is very unsatisfactory. The use process is very cherished, the built-in screen saver actually bubbles, it is less than a month, alas, Sang Xin. In comparison, I prefer the standard version of mate40, the pro is a bit big and heavy for me. Congratulations to Huawei! Anyway, still support! Battery life: I don't think it's amazing, just swipe Weibo, check WeChat, all the ones that should be turned off are turned off, and I have to study why the power down so fast. Communication quality: the sound is still good. Running speed: The new phone must be very fast. The last phone, P10, has been used for more than three years, and it is still great in the end. Therefore, it is ideal to comment on the running speed after three years. Display effect: When you get it, you will find that there is a big green edge.

,"Zhou Dongyuping, everything else is good, the green screen is really uncomfortable, I hope Huawei can solve this problem, and I hope Huawei can do better and better",,"felt a little uncomfortable buying Huawei this time. I originally thought that Huawei, as the backbone of the nation, should support it even if it uses a lot of domestic parts. I didn¡¯t expect that the green screen problem was too obvious after I bought it. I¡¯m not unreasonable, but Huawei customer service gave me The feeling is to evade responsibility and avoid problems. Let me ask, generously admitting what happened to the mixed screen, and it is understandable that the domestic screen needs to be improved. Why can't you admit it? They have been telling me that the quality is qualified. Consumers will return them for re-inspection if they feel that there is a problem. If they fail to meet the requirements, they will be responsible for the freight. If you sell all BOE screens and they are unqualified, do you dare to leave the factory? Aren't you going to join the Consumers Association? The problem is that the factory came out with a green screen problem. The other one, I have been telling you that I don¡¯t want to exchange the goods, or I don¡¯t agree with the nearby Huawei store to deal with the problem. How can I go out under the conditions of the epidemic? Then your customer service directly shirk the responsibility? I hope this is not a problem of Huawei, but the ability of the grassroots to solve problems is not enough, and it needs to be improved. I hope that Huawei is getting better and better, just don¡¯t make everyone sad because one or two small things can¡¯t be handled well. I believe Huawei¡¯s Technology, but don't look down on Huawei's customer service",

The workmanship is average, the glass plate of the rear camera is slightly biased, and the customer service says that the error is normal! A lot of software is not very suitable, and it is not smooth and smooth to use. Generally speaking, it is not worth snapping up, and the price/performance ratio should be considered in normal purchases. If you haven't bought it, it is not recommended to start. When you don't play monkeys, you should consider whether to buy it or not. My suggestion is that it is not recommended to start.",,"Suddenly I found out that Huawei doesn't let me place orders for mobile phone products. I can't place orders for mobile phone products in the whole store. It's not as good as Xiaomi Blue Green Factory, which can afford it, and has no stomach at all!

Later, I found out that my friend's same mobile phone did not have these problems, and after the customer service agreed to send it back to the warehouse for testing, but the warehouse refused to accept it, it was almost a week, and it still stayed in Dongguan. Finally, the customer service told me to let me take it to the local service store to check. Is the testing equipment and technology of a small local service shop higher than that of the general warehouse? The responsibility of the warehouse is pushed to the customer service, and the responsibility of the customer service is pushed to the service shop.

,"Other features: The appearance is just two words, bursting the table, a good-looking batch, and the texture of the bare metal is nothing to say. The face recognition is super fast and convenient for taking pictures: the night scene is very strong, and the friends next to the 50x zoom are crying. Other functions are still being explored. Anyway, taking pictures is not a blow ¡ú_¡ú. Battery life: After a day of use, there are still more than ten or twenty batteries at night. When watching videos occasionally, the battery is still very strong. Apple is really incomparable. The 66w charging is also very fast. Generally, it can be fully charged in less than an hour, but it seems to be a little slower for the first time. Usually, it is fast and slow, but it is not much worse. In short, it is quite fast. It's a pity that there is no other 66w charging head for sale in the store, so we can only use 25 or 40w charging head for backup. It is recommended that Huawei add an extra 66w charging head. Running speed: The daily speed is very fast. However, one or two softwares such as Taobao occasionally send neural cards*, and some files in the software cannot be opened directly, such as DingTalk, it is a little more troublesome to transfer to WPS, and WeChat files seem to be opened with the built-in QQ browser to browse. Apple users have turned over, and the system interface, input method, etc. are still adapting to the display effect: I like to mention Zhou Dongyu, (visually it is basically Zhou Dongyu now) I am used to it and don¡¯t feel it.

Don't compare it with other good screens, such as mi11 or fruit, you will be hit hard hhh, you can use it by yourself ??... In addition, the phone is very big, I am not used to it at first, I am afraid of falling, but I watched the online video a few days ago, and Zhou Dongyu tested the screen on the real machine. The hardness is very high. I am a little relieved.",,"Other no problem, except Taobao! ! ! ! ! Mobile Taobao! ! ! ! ! Opening the product interface often does not pop up, it is blank.

I was still watching it late at night. I have no choice but to accept the star screen, and it will be better after turning off the screen and expanding it. I think that it will only be used for 2 or 3 years, not a lifetime. I give myself peace of mind, and I also envy those lucky ones who got lgSamsung screens. After a few days of trial, I don¡¯t think it¡¯s that powerful. I haven¡¯t succeeded in flipping photos according to the instructions (maybe I don¡¯t know how to do it myself).

I have also played with my friend's Mi 10pro and Mi 11 from Xiaomi Home. In terms of quality, Xiaomi is still far from Huawei and Samsung. Of course, the price is also here. As for the screen part, what I buy now is basically arranged by BOE. Before receiving the goods, I have already prepared in my heart. In fact, the look and feel of the hand is one word: poor. Except for the two very abrupt green edges, the whole screen is obviously not transparent enough compared to my mate30 (non-pro, Samsung screen). I bought it for my father.

The curved screen is a bit uncomfortable",,"bought a mobile phone for a week, and I'm here to complain about this Huawei that thousands of people admire, really, I'm so tired! First of all, it is very difficult to buy. Make an appointment on the official website before listing, and then it shows that there has been a queue. The Huawei store near your home will increase the price by 1500 yuan, and you must bundle the broken screen insurance to buy it together for two years, which will cost you more than 9000. No one's money comes from strong winds. If you think I'm lying, you can go and see if the store next to Chengdu Great World, which is opened with Apple, is selling it at a higher price. Finally, around February 14th, the Tmall mall is in stock, hurry up to place an order, waited for half a month, and finally arrived! Speaking of mobile phones, there is no suspense. I won the bid for the big green-edge star screen, and I struggled for a long time. It is true that the original mobile phone is no longer good, and I dare not buy Apple. I don¡¯t know when to buy an Apple mobile phone. After the mobile phone arrived, I confirmed the receipt and kept comforting myself to ignore the big green edge. As a result, I commented on the problem of the green edge. After receiving a call from the after-sales customer service, I made a quibble. The same price, some people are LG screen, mine is BOE big green edge, if it is you, are you willing? After another two days, I found that the screenshot of the knuckles failed. I asked the customer service and said that it was a problem with my tempered film. I also asked me to tap harder. How to increase the strength and hit it with a hammer? Are you saying this is funny? Give me a lesson. The mobile phone in front of me is Huawei mate10pro, which is right at hand. The same flashing tempered steel film can easily take a screenshot of the knuckles. Is it slap in the face? Then there is no way for me to go to the after-sales inspection, issue a report, and then deal with it!",

During the period, the system has been updated several times, which solved the problem of charging heating, and the temperature has been greatly reduced without affecting the charging speed. In addition, the green edge of the screen at the beginning is basically invisible now, and the whole is getting better and better. It is also worth mentioning that some of Huawei's black technologies, such as remote operation, the gospel of eating and chasing dramas, as well as the design of screen capture, application split screen and other functions, are very convenient",

After using it for 3 years, the memory of 128 is almost full, and it is a bit stuck, and deleting some things can be smooth again! Feel the experience is okay.

After a week of waiting, the delivery is amazing! The green edge is acceptable, it is not so serious, it can basically be ignored! I have also paid attention to 40 before.

,"It's really fragrant after using it for a few days, just changed it from an apple. The degree of discomfort is low, the interface and iOS operation are very similar, and the theme members can download a lot of themes for 7 days. Many functions are still being explored, and the air gesture highlights are not prominent. There are few application scenarios, such as Douyin only Can slide up and down but not left and right, other programs can be used less, the custom picture and time text of the screen interface are too small, and the song being played will not be displayed on the screen Face recognition does not automatically unlock. The super hardware is indeed a few streets away from Apple, but the detailed operation is too complicated and the light adjustment is not easy. I hope that Hongmeng can make more optimizations. In the end, the charging and battery life are really different compared to Apple. It is really fully charged within 40 minutes. After a day of intensive use, Baiyun does not need to recharge. For 3 hours in a row, the best effect basically uses 30% to 50% of the power. Specifically, it depends on whether 5g is turned on or not, and 5g consumes more power. And the heat dissipation is also very good. The king did not get hot for 3 consecutive hours.",,"can't say I'm disappointed, I can only say I'm extremely disappointed. The camera is a selling point. In many cases, the focus problem is blurred. There is no corresponding camera support for close-up shots. Gestures are also one of the selling points.

Before I bought it at JD, the screen was so green that the edge of the font was blurred, and it hurt my eyes to look at it! This time I didn't have any hope of placing an order. But the result was unexpected. I felt that my luck was so good all of a sudden. This time, the edge of the screen was not green, but gray! I suddenly felt steady.

The first reason is that the curved screen is too uncomfortable for the poor to use, the large straight screen is much more comfortable, and the curved screen is really a waste protective film, and the film breaking rate is at least 4 times that of the large straight screen. Secondly, taking pictures is not as good as 20X, the macro of 40PRO is scum in front of the super macro of 20X. For people like Pindao who like to take some detailed photos, this gap is very large; in addition, in normal photos, although 40PRO is It is said that more advanced components are used, but the imaging effect is not as good as 20X, especially the enlarged pixels. Thirdly, it is power consumption, heat generation and battery life. The 20X generates less heat, and generally has a cold feel. The battery is also larger and more durable. It is charged once a day for heavy use, and usually twice every three days; the 40PRO is really hot. High, the battery is also small, the power consumption is really fast, charging twice a day is a common thing, and it is often a bit hot. In other respects, I feel that it is not much different from the 20X, especially after upgrading Hongmeng, there is no major difference in the experience of the system and software.

I hope that in the future (if there are tools like mobile phones in the future), there will be a large straight screen like the 20X.",

Brightness resolution or something, saying that there is no activation of the mobile phone, using the guarantee of no scratches on the appearance, etc., can be returned for seven days without reason. Then I adjusted the resolution and turned off the application extension according to the online statement. The two green edges are not so obvious. In fact, I don¡¯t care too much about the green edges. , Second, I think the mobile phone is really okay, the camera is not bad, no problems have been found in the current use, and the running speed is OK.

Too disappointed!",

It's a little heavy, but it doesn't affect it much, mainly because the screen is big and comfortable to use. I bought a broken screen insurance, and I may change to a thinner film later. Now this tempered film affects the use very much, and the appearance film is still smooth.",,"As for the picture quality, this is a picture, and some screenshots after zooming in...

(In order to avoid some people swaying, I have tried all parameters, all lighting conditions I have also tried it all. It has nothing to do with the use. It is the problem of the shooting function of the mobile phone. No matter how bright the sun is, whether it is 4K or 1080p, the photo card is not wrong. Unless you only use a fixed camera to shoot, if you move the lens, no matter how slow, the camera will appear stuck. frame, there are also many reviews on the Internet pointing this out), I talked about this problem in the pollen club, but someone took the fixed camera to call me black...

Only taking pictures is better, it is easier to use than the m9, the automatic mode can easily take good pictures, the automatic background blur of people, and the automatic macro are all super easy to use. The night scene is also very good, very dark places can be photographed well. The camera function is much more powerful than the m9.",,"After using it for a few days, I found a major problem. It is too difficult to focus on close-up and macro! It turns out that when the m9 is at a point on the screen, it immediately focuses on the position of the point, but this 40pro is basically inaccurate. For example, when taking a leaf on a tree, it will never be correct! As long as the lens has a distant view, it must be aimed at the distant view. The same is true for macro, it is difficult to find the desired point. There is also the so-called magnification dozens of times, I don't know what is the use.

,"Huawei is the Shangganling-Jin political commissar of the Sino-US technology war.

Kirin 9000 is the world's first 5nm5gsoc, the baseband is integrated, and most mobile phones are plug-ins now.

In addition, he really has a lot of useful small functions, it is very convenient to take a screenshot from the air. I have been using the s9+ from the samsung s4 before, and I feel that the samsung is getting more and more mediocre. After switching to Huawei, the experience has really taken a step forward. Coupled with Huawei's multi-screen collaboration, he will call the computer's speakers, microphone and screen, and there is a feeling that one plus one is greater than two. I think it's well worth the money.",,"I've been using it for about half a month, and I don't feel any dissatisfaction.

The exchange warehouse is not ready to install a new machine, that is, it will not be exchanged for others in the future? Why don't you check if there is any stock when you agree to exchange it? Even if there are two warehouses, then you agree with me knowing that I want to change them, so why not reserve them? After so long, I was told on Monday that it was out of stock, I said I didn't want a refund and wanted a mobile phone, and told me that a specialist would handle it. As a result, I called customer service twice during the period, and only contacted me on Friday. Tell me about the above, there is still stock when you agree to exchange, but it will be gone by me.

The green edge of the screen was only obvious when I looked at the white background interface. Inside. The battery life is good, and it's durable under light use, but none of them lasts under heavy use of course. The fever is normal when playing games, but it doesn't get hot to the touch. The uncomfortable thing is that the game can't be hung up because the screen does not support the setting to never sleep. I checked and said that the screen may burn. Overall, the experience is good, but I hope this screen Solve the problem as soon as possible (the above is my experience of using the machine for 3 days)",,"These are the effects I shot, using intelligent AI, after all, they are not professional, haha",

It hurts to think of changing the screen. According to the previous experience of using mobile phones, there will be many problems after changing the screen. The 7000 yuan machine is very bad! ! !

The power consumption is very fast. I went to test and said that the hardware is no problem. It is a system problem.

Selling such a product at such an expensive price disappointed the Chinese, and the customer service said that there was no way but to use it.

,"Works great, the color is really nice",,"It's very easy to use, fast, not stuck, and thanks to buying it early, it seems to be expensive again",
,"wanted to buy it since it was released. The ring camera is really good-looking, and the color matching is also the best in summer, but considering the durability, I finally bought the glaze white. The signal is really invincible, and no one brand can beat it. This is the biggest reason for continuing to buy Huawei. In terms of photography, it is still Huawei style, and the white balance is inaccurate, which is still a bit different from Apple. The charging is faster than the previous 40W, but it is still a little behind the Xiaomi vivo next door. The system is relatively stable, and it can compete with iOS. The biggest flaws are the weight and screen. The weight is a bit heavy and the hand feel is a bit poor. The green edge of the screen is indeed serious, but it does not affect the use. The battery needs to be charged three times a day, for moderate players. A phone at this price should have a better screen. Although there are many shortcomings, it still does not affect my continuing to buy Huawei. After all, the Mate40 series is likely to be Huawei's swan song, which is really a pity, a pity, a pity. It is rare for Huawei's mobile phone to rise up, and as a result, the white skin is jealous. If you fall behind, you will be beaten. Come on Huawei and come on China.",,"Let me talk about my personal feelings about the mate40Pro that I changed this time. First, the signal is really powerful. I used mate30 5G before. The biggest reason is that I continue to buy Huawei because of the signal. The most intuitive feeling is that when I go to the mountains, other brands have almost no signal, but I can surf the Internet. Second, the system, although nothing special, is stable. However, the software is double-open, only WeChat and QQ can be opened, which is not as good as MIUI. The update is not as fast as MIUI, MIUI is more user-friendly. Third, charging, 66W is really possible, but the charging speed of the 40W mate30 used before is not as fast as the 30W of Xiaomi Mi 10. Also, the mate40 still has a 40W charging rate, which is very pitiful. The mate40 feels much better than the Pro, but it doesn't have 66W, which I care more about. The entire nova series has 66W, but the mate40 does not have it, it sucks. Fourth, taking pictures seems to be much better than mate30. However, the white balance of video shooting is still not as good as that of the iPhone. The iPhone is really good for shooting video, or the pixel of the iPhone is not high, but the photos taken are not bad, and the color reproduction is very high, which is my favorite. But when I think of the iPhone's signal, forget it. Fifth, the screen does have green edges on both sides. If you only look at the screen of the mate40, you will not feel it, but compared with the other iPhone 12 mini, it is indeed not as good as the mini. Sixth, due to the high refresh rate of the screen, the power consumption is a bit high.",
,"Playing WeChat, swiping Douyin, if I use it like this, it takes about 8 hours to go from 100% to 0%, with an average of 12.5% per hour. Playing games is another matter, I didn't try it.

If you buy a Kirin 9000, you have to buy one less, and if you don¡¯t buy it, you have to go to the scalper to buy it at a higher price.

,"From mate8 until this mate40pro, I didn't buy mate10, but I also bought two mate9s. I don't like this mate40pro the most, and I have been hesitating whether to buy it or not, because it is not a straight screen. The hand feel is good, but the green edge is also annoying. In the past, the mobile phone has always been broken without a cover and the screen is broken. Now this curved screen is afraid that it is easy to break with a cover.",,"After using it for a while, I feel that the key setting of the mobile phone is a bit higher than that of the mate30.

,"After using it for 2 days, I feel pretty good in all aspects, mainly because I chose Huawei with a system that I am used to Android. Of course, there will be a little patriotic feeling, but I am dissatisfied with 3 points. The green borders on both sides are indeed a bit visually appealing. It looks a little ugly, but it doesn't affect the use. 2. I read other people's comments that the battery life is good, but the actual battery life is still a bit poor. I need to charge it at least 2 times a day. I don't play games. The third point is that when the network is not good, the white screen of the machine will also appear, but it will not be stuck for a long time at most about 5 seconds. It's still very clear, but it still takes some time to focus. The design is very distinctive and beautiful, the screen is big enough and the colors are good, but the sound quality is still lacking a little noise. There will be a little sense of loss. It is the first time to use a Huawei mobile phone, and I hope that it will not be too stuck after a long time.",,"have been using it for a while to evaluate, please allow me to tell the truth. The sound quality is really unsatisfactory. The battery life is not up to expectations. I am disappointed.

,"Commodity: Good or strong is not good. I didn't pay attention to the difference between the standard and the package, and I asked Wangwang that the whole robot didn't know what to do. The structure grabbed the standard version of the castrated version (without the standard configuration of the charger and charging cable). If I knew that there would be a lack of 66W super fast charging for less than 200 yuan, I would definitely not choose the standard configuration. I have been using Huawei all the time, from mate8 to now using mate10, I also bought mate30Pro for my wife, fake is also a loyal customer of Huawei, but this time I am also greatly disappointed. I have the charging head, mate10, mate30Pro can be used. But it's almost 7,000 yuan, and it also saves 66W fast charge. This kind of marketing is really bad and uncomfortable. If possible, I really want to add 200 to change the fast charging service: Huawei's running memory is still lower than others, but it is one or two thousand more expensive than Xiaomi 11, VIVO, and OPPO. I am used to Huawei, and I hope to support Huawei. However, this time I was really disappointed. But not disappointed with the phone",,"On the second day after the initial evaluation, there was a customer service call to respond, saying that it was an apology, and that a charger was needed, which could be purchased at an offline store, and it was only 199 yuan. I believed it and said it was all right, and later learned it was just a lie. I believed that I really went to the physical store and wanted to buy it. The clerk said that the charger was not sold in the store. Shouldn't be big. I also went to the Huawei mall to snap up a purchase. It¡¯s embarrassing. I¡¯ve already snatched it more than ten times. How small is the number of snapped purchases, and is it even released? Want to find your little Er, see if there is any way or channel to buy this 66W charger, Xiao Er said that the 40W charger is also enough, it is in stock, or you can buy the 476 yuan wireless charging package version, which is inside I don't accept the 66W charger, the rest is just sorry or sorry. I actually don't need to apologize, I bought 40PRo, and I have the right to have a 66W super charge. There is a performance of 66W super charging in the data promotion. If it is missing, it is to buy a defective Huawei mobile phone. Not to mention your mistakes and omissions in the panic buying page, and that I failed to fulfill the obligation to answer the consultation before the panic buying, but a robot customer service was responding. I think that I am a 40Pro consumer, and it is my right to have a set of 40Pro original chargers. I will not continue to waste my energy playing any more snap-buying games.

The phone is quite thin, the camera is just a little protruding, and to be honest, the heat is not serious, I belong to a semi-heavy gamer, before the p30p screen was aged and turned green because of playing games, which is a regular heat. 11u I bought and charged halfway and reminded me that the temperature is too high.

The seller asked me to pay the shipping fee first, and the seller will refund the shipping fee if there is a problem with the quality. Received the return and said the phone was ok. The reason I sent it back was that there was a problem with the film, and I didn't say that there was a problem with the quality of the phone, because I didn't test it and I didn't know if there was any problem with the quality of the phone.

,"In the past 8 years, Apple users bought Huawei because of their feelings. They were not used to it in the first two days. Now they have used it for about ten days. The appearance of the mobile phone is exquisite, the high-end atmosphere is properly high-end, and the new phone runs fast. It is true that the sides of Zhou Dongyu's screen are a little green, but I don't think there is much problem. I like the camera ring layout, it is more beautiful than Apple's , it is better than Apple in terms of good signal and battery durability, 66W fast charging is fast, and there are many advantages. The only thing I'm not satisfied with is taking pictures, which should be Huawei's advantage. The pictures of myself are white and beautiful, but I always feel that they are not as real as Apple's (I admit that Apple's original camera makes me very accepting of the real me). In addition, focusing is very laborious. Because of work reasons, I often have to take paper materials. Apple will not be blurred when I take pictures. Huawei always has a hard time taking pictures clearly. The paper photographed by the mobile phone is more dirty and the handwriting is more blurred. It made me have to keep using my old phone to take material photos.",,"The previous comparison picture was taken at the same time and under the same lighting conditions. Picture 1 is the original Apple camera that is really casual. Picture 2 is Huawei's careful focus shot, the best shot selected, and the reflection effect is eliminated, but it doesn't seem to make much difference.

In Figure 3, my friend's p40pro on the left side recognizes the food and my mobile phone on the right side is macro again. As a new phone that has been in hand for less than a month, I can only think that there is a problem with the camera function of this phone. There is also the touch screen camera function. The customer service said that it was deleted for optimization, but it is precisely that function that is the most useful function when taking selfies. It is said that it is optimized but deleted. This is simply speechless. Originally, if the previous phone hadn't been completely broken, I couldn't wait for the P50 to come out. I really wouldn't have tried the mate.

It can also be wirelessly charged in reverse, which can be used as a power bank for emergency use. The signal is stable and the photos are clear. After upgrading the Hongmeng system, the usage habits have not changed much from Android, and it feels more concise and convenient. When opening multiple applications at the same time, it feels smoother than Android, without feeling stuck, and without frequent manual cleaning of applications. The above is the good feeling I used. The bad thing is that the color of Populus euphratica in autumn is too difficult to photograph. It took a long time to grab it online.

I got it and tried emui on the same day, and it was a little stuck when I swiped. After I upgraded Hongmeng, this kind of thing happened again. Generally speaking, I am quite satisfied, but I am a little confused about this screen with curved edges and green edges. Is this the legendary Zhou Dongyu screen?

Don't be impulsive to pay for your feelings, manufacturers are all in business, and it is not easy for consumers to make money.

Now I have dual mobile phones. It is the first time to buy a Huawei mobile phone. I have used other Android phones. I feel that it is not as good as Huawei.

There are quite a lot of built-in advertisements in Hongmeng, especially the negative one-screen advertisements! 4. Hongmeng still needs to be optimized, and the power consumption is quite serious. When can the volume of Hongmeng be tuned according to each software? 5. No chargers, I don't know if Huawei does not send chargers in the name of environmental protection. If so, then it is pure disgusting people, and Apple's disease is not Apple's life! ! Furthermore, does Huawei not need new users now?

The battery life is not as strong as the V30P. It only takes 5 hours to play the king. The next day after the update of Hongmeng, after the phone was turned on, half of the screen was black, and it was normal after restarting.

The camera is really powerful, much better than Apple's. It's a pity that I only use Huawei now. After arriving in Hongmeng system, the operation fluency is stronger than that of Apple system.

The after-sales service is very good, but the processing ability of customer service is still somewhat different. The three manual customer service reps are different.

When charging, the phone will be a little hot but not very hot. It should be the reason of fast charging. After charging, it will return to normal.

,"The good mood that I finally grabbed was ruined. The customer service feedback from the commissioner pushed three and four. The details page said whether there is a charger to see the package, so I went to ask if there is a charger in the package I purchased. The order number said that this product has a charger. In the end, when I received the goods, I found that the mobile phone was not delivered at all. Without the charger, it could not be charged at all. At first, I said that because the store did not have the charger, I could not re-issue the goods with the charger at the back. Then I said If they don't reissue the charger anyway, they will take their mouths away, saying that some of them say that the answer is wrong and they let consumers wait for two days to solve the problem, and then there is still no solution. But after paying so much money, I didn't even have a good shopping experience. At first, it was just to confirm whether I needed to buy an additional charger by myself, and then I didn't buy it myself, but this kind of inconsistency in words and deeds and only apologizing brought about inconvenience. The behavior of a good shopping experience is really chilling. A single misunderstanding can take back all your mistakes. How can consumers believe your words? Say yes today, and say sorry in a day. The gift for apology is still the same. The things that don¡¯t sell directly in the store for tens of dollars, let¡¯s talk about the backpack first, and then say that the backpack is not the kind of the store. The 199 is an ordinary backpack. The selfie stick 119 is still in stock at the beginning, and then it starts to say that it is out of stock when it feels a little more expensive. , cheap unsuitable headphones are in stock. Not even a good apology and attitude. Huawei is indeed a powerful company in the country, but it is not a reason for consumers to tolerate without reason",,"Not all pictures can be sent. There are a bunch of often discounted 3.5 earphones that don't fit mobile phones. There is no such apology and sincerity at all. Is it useful to say sorry every day for a bad experience? Can you improve the experience of consumers? The pictures are incomplete. In a word, I have to wait. There is no solution. Compensation is too lazy to pursue accountability. When the words and deeds are inconsistent, it is just an apology. There is no measure to remedy and retain. There are a lot of consumers who really want to grab it, but if this attitude continues, one by one will be lost sooner or later. One person consumes, and it is only issued to let everyone who wants to buy it spend so much money without even having a good experience, so think twice. I don't mean the money for this charger, but I hate this kind of deceitful behavior. I am afraid that the customer service will see it wrong and verify it again and again. I can only rest assured that there is a charger. I waited for two days. In this way, I contacted the rising commissioner step by step, and finally I became more and more attitude and left an apology. I really want to apologize, this attitude will really not buy again in the future. I hope everyone who sees it thinks twice, it is not a small sum of money, but also needs a good after-sales service and attitude to feel it is worth it. It doesn't make me feel worth it at all, it's just chilling",

This Double Eleven was originally aimed at Apple 13Pro, but I specially charged 88 members, but the wave of Apple on the 1st was out of stock... I helped my family buy Huawei mate40Pro on snyg. After receiving the goods, I feel that I can add friends to crazy Amway. , so I tried to grab it on the official website, and I happened to find it on the official website, and I grabbed it. Appearance, feel are good, the secret silver is very beautiful. But it is a star screen passed on the Internet, and the green edge is still very obvious. If you use it, you are not very familiar with it, and you are still exploring. Some APPs commonly used by the company cannot be downloaded, such as fastmail and basecamp, and can only be opened on web pages. It has been used for more than a week, and the intuitive feeling has become much more intelligent (maybe because I transferred it from an old Apple model), but downloading, there is no Apple clean, there will be some pushes and incidents. In terms of signal, it is indeed better than an apple in a corner. Electricity is also a major factor to consider. But after using it, it is not as good as my friend Amway. I go out with a full battery in the morning on a business trip. I don¡¯t watch videos or play games. I just use WeChat and send and receive emails. When the battery runs out at 3 o¡¯clock in the afternoon, it shuts down, haha. The 66W charger purchased offline costs 199 yuan, and the charging is really super fast. Oops, I wrote too much... Maybe it took too long to decide to switch to Huawei, so I'm chatting haha",,"After using it for more than two months, I did not specifically learn the functions of the mobile phone. I just explored and asked friends when I used it, so many functions may not have been understood and used. Let's talk about the disadvantages first: 1- Many apps cannot be used. Several foreign trade friends around have switched back to Apple because of the HM system. 2-Download is not as rigorous and concise as Apple. Sometimes the help link sent by others, the app that you don't have on your phone, just click and download... 3-WeChat voice has noise/stutter. It happened five or six times, and my friend said it was a network problem. Basically, it was used in WIFI state. The first second was normal, and the next second, it suddenly became ill, and I was caught off guard. It can only be repaired by restarting. The video is stuck, and I forgot to record the noise problem. 4- Occasionally, the screen is blank, and it has only happened once that the icons on the screen are stuck in a fine grid, thinking that I am dazzled and forgot to take a screenshot. Of course, many of Huawei's functions are still very useful! ! ! One-handed mode, the welfare of the small hand party! Split screen mode, shopping while watching the show! Chat while watching the show! Small windows and floating windows are too user-friendly! It is also very useful to take screenshots, screen recordings, image text recognition, etc.! In short, if the necessary (work) apps for you can¡¯t be downloaded, it¡¯s okay (for example, some apps that I use for work can be opened through the web page), it¡¯s still a good idea to switch to Huawei! Everyone says that whether the phone is good or not depends on whether it will be stuck after a year or two. I hope Huawei can stand the test, haha! Let's talk about it at that time.",
,"I finally got it during the Double Eleven. I was so tired. I didn¡¯t stay up until 12 o¡¯clock in vain. I really love the green. I have been waiting for the green. Without the charger package, I bought an additional 199 fast charge, which is actually cheaper than the package with the charger, which is a bit funny",,"It's really good to use, it's worth staying up late to grab it, the color is so beautiful and I like it, this price will take 5 years",
,"Huawei P40Pro, powerful functions, good performance, high-end appearance, atmosphere! The store ships, the delivery is fast, the service is good",,"The phone is good, I have used it for a while, it runs very smoothly, and it looks beautiful!",
,"There are scratches on the screen, I don¡¯t know if it¡¯s the return machine or the quality control is poor, but I managed to grab it (I saw JD.com yesterday that I can place an order without grabbing it, and I can choose the color casually, I¡¯m fooled), I¡¯m too lazy to toss, I¡¯ll do it soon Use it, just blame your own patriotism, not next time",,"The scratches are on the original film, the machine has not been used, and no other problems have been found for the time being, that is, there is no charger and data cable, and you need to buy it yourself",
,"The logistics is super fast, I placed the order on the 8th and received it on the 9th. After using it for a few days, it's fine. I don't play games. I don't have too many requirements for my mobile phone. I can retire the Honor V9 after using it for four years.",,"At the beginning, I didn¡¯t care about the power consumption of the update. It has been used for a while now. I lost five or six batteries a night. I didn¡¯t charge the phone to play, I didn¡¯t play large games, I basically didn¡¯t download other software, and the memory still had 200g. It is normal for me to charge twice a day if I use it moderately. I basically don¡¯t use my mobile phone at work. The screen is bright for more than four hours, and the standby time is only about thirty-two hours when fully charged. Others¡¯ mate40pro has a minimum standby time of fifty or more hours. The Honor V9 has more than 70 hours of standby time. I don't understand how this power is consumed?",
,"Rubbish Huawei, deceive consumers, the parameters and specifications have a charger, but they do not give it, it is fraudulent propaganda",,"When selling, there is no so-called package option. When you are arguing, you know that you can come up with a package and talk, garbage Huawei.",

,"The order placed on the afternoon of the 26th was received on the morning of the 27th. The Hongmeng system has been updated, which is very easy to use. The most important thing is that the supply of goods was sufficient that afternoon, so there was no need to rush. . Ha ha. .",,"Forgot to say, the only thing that is more pitted is that there is no charger",
,"Camera effect: pretty good Battery life: pretty good Communication sound quality: pretty good Running speed: Hongmeng system is quite smooth Display effect: Like to mention star screen, contrast is not good enough, quite bad Other features: star screen, double digging holes, curved screen , the experience is not good. Does it have to be a curved screen to be high-end? Anyway, I won't buy a mobile phone with a curved screen again, and I can't afford such a high-end mobile phone. I bought it with the mentality of supporting Huawei. The ring rear camera is very beautiful. It may be an out-of-print chip. 5G mobile phone is irreplaceable in my heart.",,"It's really good to take pictures, but without her beauty and beauty, and the picturesque landscape of the motherland, what would you do with a mobile phone? Always feel like something is missing. I'm not used to the curved screen, and I want to transfer it to someone with a predestined relationship. A fish search user: August Tianxia",
,"used the mate30 for two years before, and it didn't get stuck. It's very good. I just want to change to a 5g one. The mall can't get it, and Taobao can't get it. One night, I can buy it suddenly... I'm very happy. Don't buy other brands, because laptops and earphones are all from Huawei, and you can't say what's good about some products, but you just can't give them up.",,"I've been using it for nearly a week, and it feels really good, but when I'm not playing the king, I always feel that the touch is not very smooth...",
,"Don't buy Apple, support Huawei",,"It has been used for a while, and there is nothing to say that it is good, fast, faster than Apple 13, this is the power of the brand, I believe the brand Come on",
,"The fruit turned over, it is not as strong as the Internet says, the only thing I am satisfied with is the signal. I grabbed three of them with my friends, all of them have big green edges, and they gave the cheapest BOE screen, and the price was the same as the more expensive Samsung and LG screens. Fruits and vegetables were sold according to their quality. Pit people!",,"It can only be said that Huawei's three kinds of screens are mixed, and the price of mobile phones is no different, and the price is still very firm. The promotion of Samsung is the first, and all of them are BOE's game of chess. Originally thought it was by luck, and I grabbed the whole big green edge with two friends. I didn't expect that all the friends around me bought this year. Only one I bought last year did not have a green edge. It really looks more and more awkward. So seriously think about it, the thief is not kind! And my mobile phone was produced in May last year according to the online method. Why did Mao also say that the mobile phone inventory is tight? Is it wrong to search online? Or another wave of operations? The Hongmeng system has been upgraded, there are bugs, and many parts of the system are not user-friendly and convenient enough! Some third-party software seems to be not very compatible, the same is true after brushing the full package, and I am too lazy to return it after upgrading, and stick to the suggestion that Hongmeng has not been upgraded, and wait for 3.0 to come out! The battery is in good condition so far. I mainly bought its own 66w fast charge. The charge is very fast and there is no battery life anxiety! That's all, don't spray me, I'm patriotic too!",
,"After two events in November, before the event, it was shown that the full discount coupon of 88vip could be used. As a result, when the full discount coupon took effect, it was directly set that the product cannot be purchased, which is also very disgusting. Do these chicken thieves. Taobao's 88 customer service complaint is just as ignorant, and they are in one accord, ****!",,"I read the receipt on 11.30, it took half a month, and it got stuck 3 times, and I never played games, even the interface of the WeChat public account, I can't return, and I can't x, but there is an icon to swipe left and right. In addition, the WeChat scan code payment failed to scan twice, the network was normal, and it came out after waiting for three or five seconds. A new mobile phone with a charger of 7,000 yuan turned out to have such an effect. What about your conscience? It's not as good as the experience of buying a new p20 for 4,000 yuan a few years ago, and I have to grab this broken mobile phone? Drunk, don't buy it!",
,The phone is beautiful! Shipping is fast! Ordered yesterday and received it this morning! The whole family is using Huawei Mate series mobile phones,,"Double 12 spent 6799 yuan to get it, and the result is that there are many black dots on the screen on January 13! It was tested by Huawei's official after-sales service center, and it was said that the screen was broken and needed to be replaced! Really speechless! Always believe in Huawei and support Huawei! But the broken screen has appeared in the past few days, so how can people support Huawei in the future? ?",
,"I regret buying this phone. I spent nearly 7000 on it, and the quality is really satisfied. The customer service will not answer the feedback and tell me a few problems. 1. The phone has been used for the third day. The customer service told me to restore the factory, clean up the garbage, and clean up the phone I just bought? Later on QQ video, there is no such problem; 2. The screen is too sensitive to slide up in the circle of friends. When you click it for the second time, it can't stop, and when you slide down, it can't slide again. 3. The curved green screen is too obvious. 4. Swipe Pippi shrimp will shake when dragging the video screen, and the screen has been recorded",,"After upgrading the system according to the seller, it is still not easy to use. To put it bluntly, there are some software incompatibility between the system and WeChat. Pippi Shrimp is still watching the video and the screen is shaking. I have no problem with other mobile phones. ; I went to Baidu once yesterday, searched for common problems, and then popped up several pop-ups in a row. In the morning, I found that the software was automatically installed, because the screenshot time was too long to upload.",

,"Compared to MATE20 without a charger, it is much better. It is better than MATE20. It is much smoother than MATE20.",,Buying a Huawei 5G mobile phone is not easy. It can be used for about 3 years. I hope that the technology blockade in the United States will be broken by then.,
,"Very rubbish, I spent 7000 yuan to buy a mobile phone and waited for more than ten days to ship it. When I received the goods, I opened it and I didn't even have a charger. Tell me that the charger will cost another 200 yuan to buy it. I will tell you the truth. I support domestic products and Huawei, but I don¡¯t support such **** merchants. I don¡¯t have a charger. I won¡¯t tell you sooner. When it arrives, I will tell me to buy another one. What kind of stuff is garbage?",,"Very rubbish, buy carefully, ** merchants, tell you the charger after buying it, and then buy it again, just do business like this",

I support Huawei wholeheartedly, and many people around me also support Huawei. I hope Huawei can do more. Come on.",,"I haven't downloaded much software, it seems that the memory takes up a lot, and it should be mostly files, photos and videos.",

The new Zhou Dongyu screen is still good and can be used.",,"As an old fan of Huawei, I really like the stable and powerful signal of Huawei's mobile phone system. It is also very good! Hold m40p and wait for the return of Kirin! ! !",
,"I'm very disappointed that the power consumption is fast. I used the card today when I swiped Taobao at noon the next day, and the card was refunded. I only spent more than 2,000 on my last mobile phone. I have used the card for almost three years. What special expectations, the greater the disappointment! ! !",,"Also, I found that it is very difficult to swipe left and right on the Alibaba software. There is no response. I don't know if it is because of the screen or the software. The second day has many problems! ! ! ! !",
,"just want to complain, it's in stock now, why do you limit the purchase? You can only buy one for an account. After giving it to my husband, I also want one, but I can't buy it with my account. The customer service keeps calling me to change the account. Or buy from a friend. How can there be so many accounts? To buy things by yourself, you have to find a friend to help you buy it. It is not unnecessary. Asking the customer service when the account will be unfrozen will not give me an answer. This is what keeps me from using Huawei. go buy another phone. . . One account and one account are really harsh conditions, so relax them appropriately. A scalper can still be a scalper, but those who really need it are limited* and have to go to the scalper to buy it. This limitation is only a formality.",,"Anyway, limit how many days you can't continue to buy, how many days after the account is unfrozen",

,"The battery life is not very good. When I make a video call with my friend at 100% for more than three hours, I have more than 30% left. The phone has green borders on both sides... Everything else is ok. At first, I felt like I took a brick. After opening it, I felt that I stole my grandfather's old phone. I hope Huawei can make it smaller in the future.",,"Brothers, it's not that I don't support domestic products! Except for the network, Huawei is very general. . . Tell everyone a nasty one. On the 2.5th, I worked hard to organize the high-level notes. At the beginning, I used document scanning, and the pixels were not ideal. It may be that my hands are shaking. Later, I took pictures directly, but the good guy couldn¡¯t share it. The first item shared, the quality of the shared image was a little better than the mosaic. The second item shared said there was no text. The third item shared requires WPS membership, good guy, later WPS directly gave me * machine! Item 4 shared requires Huawei products! Co-authoring is a big deal. I thank Huawei for letting me know that Apple is so good. In terms of learning, it is really really good.",
,"OMG! I never thought that Huawei would learn from Apple to do such disgusting things! The charger has to be bought separately, but I don¡¯t remind you that Huawei has never said to buy it alone after buying it for so many years! Don't remind me yet! Originally, I bought this model before a new phone was released. Is it really necessary to do this kind of thing? Huawei? The same is true of express delivery. It has to be delivered to me. There are express cabinets at the collection point. Then I will deliver it to my home at the company. When I get home, it says that it will be delivered to the company. Are you playing hide-and-seek? It's cute isn't it!",,"After buying Huawei for so many years, it is indeed the first time that I have encountered a situation without a charger, but after understanding the situation, I understand that I already have a lot of chargers and there is no need to buy additional ones, so I launched a basic package without a charger. While Package 1 is available, I have not seen it, so it is recommended to have a more obvious reminder. Regarding the logistics problem, I think it is correct to insist on delivering it to me. It is indeed related to the fact that it was not delivered to me because I was late when I went home. Although I gave a bad review, I think that this method is not wrong. I am more impulsive. Huawei's feedback attitude is still in line with the image in my mind. It doesn't seem to be going well recently. There is no new progress in mobile phones. I still hope that Huawei can do better and better. I feel a little guilty for the bad review I gave in the past, so I'll give it another five stars manually.",
,"Since Huawei P6 (2013), Huawei has been used and witnessed the rise of domestic mobile phone brands represented by Huawei. It's only been two days since I got it, and the follow-up needs to be improved... It's just this purchase experience, I'm not satisfied! The provincial capital city ""same city"" EMS took three days to receive the goods, and can only give 1 point to the logistics, and this 1 point means that the goods were received. Feedback to customer service is only an apology. There is no solution and no meaning. As a top domestic representative, should I represent the top in all aspects? Regardless of whether it is a good supply chain or a partner, we all hope that Huawei will become better and better, instead of sloppy treatment of consumer feedback and complaints. This way the road will only get narrower and narrower.",,"After use, praise! Signals and photos are all very good. As a loyal fan of Huawei, I expect Huawei to launch more products every year. Come on.",
,"For the time being, I feel that I can use it for a few days before reviewing it. This price is indeed the lowest.",,"I read the comment area, a little bit of green on both sides of the screen, and a little bit of my own, and a little bit of a card. The price is more expensive than 13, which is a bit not worth it",
,"Other features: I like the white color, and the grip is very round. Photo effect: telephoto is not bad. The focusing speed is relatively slow. The built-in Leica filter is fine. The wide angle doesn't feel wide enough. Battery life: Hard to last all day with moderate/heavy use. Running speed: no obvious bugs Disadvantages: 1. Wearing a mask can't unlock your face, you can only unlock it with a fingerprint, you can't unlock it if you try it once, and it's still the same after re-recording your fingerprint. Compared with the side-touch capacitive fingerprint unlock of the Honor p20pro that I used before, the under-screen fingerprint unlocking is really much slower, and it feels a bit unreasonable that it is slower than the Honor four years ago. 2. There is a wireless charging function, but if I want to use this function, I have to buy a 66w fast charging plug for 200 yuan + 50w wireless charger for 329 yuan. At first, I thought I could just plug it in after I bought a ""wireless charger"", but when I got it, there was no plug and cable, and I had to buy a 200 yuan fast charging plug to use it. It¡¯s like when I bought instant noodles without seasoning packets, I put up with it, then I¡¯ll buy the seasoning packets myself, but there is no salt in the seasoning packets, so I have to put the salt myself. In the end, it took 529 to realize the mobile phone charging function... Finally, send a wide-angle and telephoto Kang Kang, I like the quality of the shooting. Display effect: The green edge is a bit obvious, but it doesn't matter if you get used to it.",,"As far as I don't understand, it is so ""environmentally friendly"" at this price, and the plugs and cables are not included, so I have to buy them separately. I'm afraid it's just to seize the consumer's mentality that ""it's not bad to buy an official plug after buying a large 7000 mobile phone. What if the charger of other brands is damaged?"" Don't give away such environmentally friendly wired earphones, and then sell the mobile phone at a lower price, and then sell the earphones separately to see who will buy your earphones alone. This is different from buying a router without a power cord, buying a wireless mouse without a usb head, and buying instant noodles without a seasoning package. Without this plug, the 66w charging you advertised can't be achieved. And the ""wireless charger"" can't be used, it must be equipped with Huawei's 66w fast charging head. I just bought something called a ""charger"" and it still can't be charged, which is outrageous. I thought it all comes with its own power cord. I bought a mobile phone without a charger, and I bought a charger with only a seat without a power cord. I put my feelings here and give me a double doll. It's a high-sounding thing to give customers more choices, but I really prefer you to include it in the price, and I never let me buy a wireless charger for 329 yuan and then spend 200 yuan to buy a plug to make people angry. This is the first time I bought Huawei. Although I knew that the mobile phone with the same configuration as a friend's merchant had a huge premium, I still insisted on buying it. I wanted to support the light of domestic products, so I hope that the shopping experience can also match the price.",

The Hongmeng system is also very easy to use, not bad. Battery life: The battery life is ok. It is charged once for about half a day in normal use, but the charging is very fast, so it does not have a big impact on the running speed: very fast, the use is smooth and smooth, and no problems have been found so far.

Pause, the sound quality is good, and I also found that the rear camera has a dander, which does not affect taking pictures and videos, so I will use it.

The phone is heavier and thicker, and the curved screen is really not good for filming, and it is easy to break. Wearing a phone case is heavier.

The close-up photography is not as good as the Apple's long-distance, and it is rarely used to shoot videos. It is still relatively blurry. The other experience is not much different from the ordinary mobile phone. Those two small holes look really uncomfortable. After the first comment, I went to the customer service and ignored me. I said that I didn't send the phone case. I felt fooled for a moment.",

I took it to the after-sale service and asked me to use it for a while before looking at it. Now that 15 days have passed, the battery is still not ideal, alas?? It is estimated that there is a problem and it cannot be replaced.",,"I don't want to talk about the quality control problem, because the test report has not been released yet, but Huawei's consumer service hotline 950800 is playing me like a monkey. After the comment, they called me the next day and said that they can help me calculate the three-pack time again. It's all for the sake of serving consumers, which made me happy for a while. The next day I called me and told me that yesterday the commissioner will handle it internally, and if there is a problem, we can only go through the warranty procedure. ????I have always liked Huawei products, and I also bought a gt2 watch, freelace, etc. to form a ""small family bucket"".

,"Due to work reasons, I can only use domestic mobile phones. I planted grass at first sight. Although the price is small, I still placed the order. After receiving it, I was amazed.

,"The mobile phone is good for taking pictures, or it comes with a mobile phone case. The mobile phone has already been filmed, but I personally feel that there is no need to film such a good screen. Putting the film on the screen will affect the visual effect.",,It took two days for the standby time to be really long. I used to go out and carry the power bank with me and now I can't use it at all.,
,"After using it for a long time, the real feeling of changing from Apple. 1. Black technology, that is, small functions, such as multi-window operation, etc., Huawei is good at it. 2. Operation experience, the p series is a high-end machine, and the operations such as closing the program and returning are basically the same as those of the Apple X. So it was quite adaptable when I first changed it. Swiping left and right to return to the previous layer is Huawei's more user-friendly setting than Apple, but I always feel that this gesture is less responsive than Apple's when using it. 3. Remote operation and screenshots must be pulled out. Telekinesis is really fun, but sometimes it's really insensitive! ! Knuckle screenshots, space screenshots and even button screenshots are really easy to use sometimes, and sometimes multiple operations can't be successful! I sometimes get angry about this! ! 4. Camera. Huawei and Apple are very different. I really don¡¯t like the beauty that comes with the front when I just got the phone. It¡¯s about beauty. Huawei¡¯s front is not as real as Apple¡¯s, and the picture quality is whiter. If you use the beauty camera, it will always feel too fake. Really beautiful. The rear Apple soft light is better, and the rear Huawei wide-angle and night shots are amazing.",,"Word limit, if you haven't finished, keep writing. For the camera, Huawei's rear shot is more colorful than Apple's, and Apple's light is softer. 5. Unlock. The p40pro supports fingerprint unlocking and face unlocking, but the face is 2D, so it only supports unlocking, not payment. What do you say, tasteless? The function is only half set, which is not satisfactory. 6. Appearance, the p40pro Frost Silver is good-looking and high-end, but the rear camera is prominent, so it must be equipped with a shell, but the body itself is relatively thick, so it feels emmm ~ average, the front has always been a slot, so I won't say more. 7. Software. I don¡¯t know if it¡¯s the software settings or the system is different. Apple¡¯s WeChat and Taobao are different from Huawei¡¯s. For example, the WeChat message bar, Apple can also send pictures while editing text, etc. Huawei can¡¯t; for the same product on Taobao, if there are more than one clothes For each color, Apple can directly click on the baby to select and swipe left and right to see pictures of different colors, but Huawei does not support it. Apple is definitely better. The real experience of using it recently, I don't like it. For your reference",

It's better to buy an Apple 11pro. The processor crushes Huawei, and the camera is better than Huawei. I regret it, and I won't give in. There is no way, the most pitiful time, these Chinese people boast that Huawei is not as good as the OnePlus 8pro version, so disappointed with Huawei, what 5G is basically useless now, now it is generally 4G, and it will be outdated when 5G is common. Apple 13 All came out in time. To buy, you fine! Fine product! Personally, I recommend buying an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 11pro. Very poor service, long reply time",,How about you take a closer look,

Specially equipped with 6+ wifi network speed is super fast, the photo is super clear, my wife likes it.",,"This phone is really fast! After a week of being picky, the comparison was not in vain. It was easy to download the software, play games on Douyin quickly, and the telecom broadband was upgraded to 300M, which is faster with Huawei router AX3pro quad-core WlFl6+. It is difficult to determine this router. Taobao ordered one to arrive in a month. I was impatient and went to Jingdong to buy a spot that cost tens of yuan and 400 yuan. I bought two routers at once, and planned to use one for each company and home, and use them all in the future. Domestic.",

,"Other Features: 50x magnification is just blurry. And it kept shaking. Can't focus. The commercials are too exaggerated. The answer from the customer service seems to be that the commercials are just for reference. Because there is a front-facing camera on the screen, I can't see the information picture myself. Every time I zoom out to see what is in the upper left corner, it is inconvenient to crop the picture. Difficult to cut into place in one go. I can't move many times, I can only start from the lower left and right corners, otherwise this picture is doomed to madden you, and you can't crop the photo effect: I will not take selfies with this phone, one word is ugly, one word is beautiful, two words are used , so ugly! And the front camera is on the left. WeChat video, but his avatar frame is displayed on the right. Every time I glance at myself in the video, I feel cross-eyed. I manually moved to the left. The video is super shaking! ! The video is super shaky, more shaky than any phone I've ever used. Unless you hold your phone to take a video and keep moving. But my hand is not a tripod, and I can't do it completely without moving at all. So you are destined to be unable to shoot a good-looking video without shaking. From getting the phone to now, the only good thing is. Close-up shots are ok, very clear and beautiful. Battery life: poor. Fully charged, it can only be used from four or five in the afternoon in the morning, and you cannot listen to music with headphones. Customers say that the power consumption is fast. I don't listen to music anymore, but the power consumption is super fast. The customer service said that the outdoor light is strong and the power consumption is fast, and all the backgrounds are cleared. Only WeChat and Taobao customer service chat pages are left. I actually watched the power numbers drop and the communication sound quality dropped: few calls were made, the video was often disconnected, and the signal display on the top of the phone was rarely full. Running speed: stuck, pressing the feedback button several times does not work. I set the display keyboard return key is not working. In addition, the traffic wireless is changed countless times a day. The telecommunications card shows 4G and 5G at one time, and uses WeChat to send information pictures and circle in circles, showing that there is no network. Is this the case with 5G mobile phones now? ! The same goes for the previous vivo. It's so expensive. I don't find it useful. Display effect: Chinese perpetual calendar. Every time I set a reminder for more than a dozen, the top display I did not cross it out, but it disappeared. It came out on its own after a while. can't understand",,"am not the only one who is talking about the fast power consumption. I can only say that it can be used for two days after full power, and the mobile phone is a hand warmer when charging. Although you can't use your phone while charging, which one of your phones hasn't been used while charging? ! But you'd never dare to use this phone while it's charging.

The phone feels heavy in the hand, but it doesn't feel particularly heavy. The camera function is really a highlight, very professional, and the photos taken hardly need to be retouched.

Objectively evaluating the 990 processor, it is basically at the same level as the 855 processor. Obviously, it is not as strong as the 865 and the Apple a13, but it is enough for playing games and so on. It is definitely no problem to use it for two years. Although the processor is not the strongest, the camera is definitely the strongest. After all, the main focus of the p series is to take pictures, and the dxo128 is not a blow.

After all, taking pictures is the biggest selling point of the p40pro. In fact, this phone is generally very good.

,"Okay, let¡¯s talk about the shortcomings first. At present, I have found two problems. One is that the personal hotspot signal is not good and the network is often disconnected. The effect of using the hotspot to connect to a computer or other mobile phones is very pitiful. The second is the poor battery storage. The 4200 mAh battery is far from storing power as expected. I play mobile games for one or two hours a day, and watch videos for a few hours before charging. The 2000mAh mobile phone that I have used for more than two years now has almost stored power. After visual inspection, after the mobile phone battery is old, it is inevitable to charge it three or four times a day. Let¡¯s talk about the advantages, that is, the publicity photo is really powerful, but the night scene under ordinary multiples is not as good as the iPhone 11, and the daytime is evenly divided, but the high multiple of more than 10 times completely hangs the iPhone 11 and all other mobile phones, which means that the iPhone 11 only compares the night scene. Excellent. 50 times is not as exaggerated as in the advertisement, more than 35 times begins to blur, but it is enough to hang any high-magnification mobile phone on the market, and other performance and unlocking are quite excellent.",,"The bad signal of the personal hotspot is caused by the use of a mobile phone case with a magnet.

Those who have already purchased should not be discouraged by thinking that it is a ""rollover"". The reasons are as follows: 1. Such scenes are not used much. It can be called photography. It can definitely use light well. Even ordinary life records are rarely used in such scenes. Record. In addition to the discussion of this issue on the pollen club, other platforms have not discussed this issue, which indirectly proves that this kind of scene is rarely encountered. 2. Although it is indeed the cause of the hardware (super-sensitive element), it can still be expected to be solved by software updates later. Attached are two pictures. The same scene went straight out, and I did get a picture without erythema. The analysis may be because the AI algorithm determines that the scene does not require super-sensitivity, so there is no erythema. A little further away, red spots appeared, and after refocusing, the screen appeared after an obvious overload. It can be roughly inferred that a judgment of AI was suddenly triggered, and erythema appeared after the scene was automatically switched. When you understand this phenomenon, there is a solution. 1. The best way is to improve the AI algorithm, so that users can operate foolishly. 2. Add the option for users to manually switch the usage scene in the settings, or manually switch the super-sensing switch. Not all scenes will necessarily use super-sensing. 3. (For users) Choose the scene yourself, and fill in the light if it doesn't work. The low-light environment is self-defined and may not be accurate. The previous photo was taken indoors in the afternoon. I just tried it. There is no erythema in the indoor incandescent lamp at night. There is no black meaning, after all, the p40 is used from the p9. The above is for reference only",

In terms of games, I don¡¯t know if I haven¡¯t played Bengbengbeng, at least Tencent can eat chicken. Regarding heat, the heat will definitely be hot. When taking pictures, it will be hot under the sun, but the heat dissipation is fast, so you can use it with confidence. Let¡¯s talk about battery life. I haven¡¯t tested how long I can play games. As far as travel is concerned, I go out after charging at 9:00 in the morning, take pictures in a high temperature and fever state, walk around and take pictures, and I still have more than 40% of electricity when I return to the hotel after 2:00 noon. Enough for daily use. Then again... The camera function that everyone cares about, I just like to take pictures casually. I can't comment on the lens or anything. Just click on the picture and everyone will feel it. The best experience is to eat it with a tripod. Unfortunately, I didn't buy it at that time... 5x optical zoom is not bad, I don't like to carry cameras, so this camera is cool! Friends with conditions, you can wait for P40P+...

Video cannot be taken at a close distance. It is difficult to take pictures within 20 cm. I know if this is the case with mobile phones, I have to take it from a distance. The photos can be taken clearly, and the close-up video shooting is blurry. The battery life is still OK. The normal brightness is within 50% of the volume and the volume is 70. Blu-ray video can be used. Watching 13 hours to 14 or so - I'm looking at Huawei's video camera effect: 50x zoom, 10x mixing, etc. I haven't experienced it yet.

Companies have systems, but people are alive",,"The customer service was also very polite when I called, but the matter was still not dealt with. I paid for my own impulse. I originally wanted to purely support Huawei for 6,000 yuan. What should I buy? Isn't it delicious?",
,"just changed my phone, and the Huawei p40 just got a big reputation. I followed the trend. Coming from ios, my previous worries were unnecessary.

Distribute the goods, no matter whether the price is reduced or not, you have no regrets about your choice. The mobile phone case, film, and bracelet cost almost 7,000. The things you like are willing to give souls. I read an article before, each mobile phone The core technology of the upgraded version (pro.x...) can be compared when there is time. Other functions of the mobile phone are slowly explored by themselves, and the things in the flagship store are really good.",

Split-screen video recording is also very good battery life: the charging speed is very fast, and the super fast charging is very powerful. It is about 40% charged in half an hour, and it can be maintained even after using it all day yesterday. It should be no problem to charge it once a day. Running speed: The speed is still quite fast. In fact, I don't understand this very well. I feel that the response is very fast. To add, the after-sale service is great. I thought there was a problem yesterday because I didn't tear the soft film. After the sale, I said that if there is a problem, I can return to the factory for inspection. There is no reason to return it, so don't worry~",,"have been using my mobile phone for a few days, and I will post a review for your reference free of charge. [Charging] Super fast charging can charge about 40%-50% of the power in about half an hour, and it is no problem to fully charge in one hour. How long the battery lasts mainly depends on how much you open in the background and what functions you use. I can charge it once a day. [Photography] I originally hesitated for a long time between iPhone11 pro max and this phone. Both of them have powerful camera functions, but I am still more used to Huawei's photography. It is easy to use, and the intelligent adjustment is also very worry-free. Looks awesome - pic 3 roses. The pixels are very clear, 30 times the moon shot properly - picture 4, wide-angle shooting is also very good - picture 5 blue sky. [Finally rant] My friends who use Macs don't recommend buying Apple recently, and some functions seem to be a bit of a hindrance. After all, it's a foreign product, and you can't do anything if they say they don't provide you with any services. It¡¯s better to support domestic production, and the 5G era is coming soon. At this time, if you change a 5G mobile phone, you don¡¯t need to update your mobile phone again to cater to the new communication technology.",

,Photo effect: so-so. Running speed: also new mobile phone.,,"The design of the front camera still needs to be changed. The screen feels like a black screen, which is a bit ugly. After taking a screenshot, there is a large blank space at the top of the picture, which is really ugly. The phone is still not smooth enough, the response is still slow, and needs to be improved. The battery life is not as advertised, not long-lasting, which surprised me! ! ! The example originally had 95% of the battery. In less than 2 minutes, after a system update and restart, 9% of the battery was used up, leaving 86% of the battery. I was shocked! ! I don't know what the problem is, please answer. Also, the mobile phone is very expensive, but I don¡¯t want to give any gifts. I don¡¯t even want to give a mobile phone case, just a transparent soft shell glue. I want to give a wireless charger, a wireless network, and a Bluetooth headset. It is estimated that the sales will be greatly increased! Why not return it? Because I support Huawei, it is expensive.",
,"It's okay, the performance of the new machine is definitely good, but I don't know what will happen after a year or two. . . . . Taking pictures is alright... It's not as magical as I said, but I'm generally not very satisfied. After installing some applications, the phone memory has used more than 30 GB... Now the memory of this mobile phone software is too large, right? You can't play it without two or three hundred gigabytes... If you can buy two hundred gigabytes, don't buy the one with 100 gigabytes... The memory is simply not enough. Taking pictures is really ordinary. doesn't have the desired effect",,It¡¯s not bad after playing for a while. It¡¯s very beautiful to take pictures of the solar eclipse. It seems that the quality of pictures has a lot to do with the environment.,
,"It's okay, I bought it from the official website, I believe the official website",,"After using it for half a month, the machine has not been hot, which is very gratifying. The only problem is that when the screen is turned off, the brightness is automatically adjusted, and the brightness of the screen is automatically adjusted. I don¡¯t know what happened. Alipay, Quark, the screen will darken, then return to the desktop, enter the phone settings, the screen will automatically brighten again, very tangled, I searched a lot on the Internet, they all say that it is a bug of Huawei system, I can't understand it! My friend and I are in this official website store with that p40, his will not",
,"1. It is not worth buying at this price, it is no different from the P20 I used before. 2. The response is too slow, and there is no joy in getting it. 3. Other problems cannot be uploaded. Friends who haven't bought it should study it and buy it. I'm a little impulsive",,"Just received the phone today, look at the response speed. Really disappointed, I have always supported Huawei, it seems that everything is blown. If you haven't bought it yet, it's best to go to the physical store and check it out. I was fooled by the live broadcast. I never write reviews, I'm so pissed today",
,"The phone heats up very badly. If you don't play games or watch videos, normal information communication and shopping websites are very hot. I did the test and found that the highest temperature in my history was 42¡ãC. I only used 42 for that little bit. If I play games, who knows how much it will be. And the official standard is different. Tmall customer service said that it is abnormal if it exceeds 45¡æ, and the detection point said that it is abnormal if it exceeds 55¡æ. I'm really hehe, 50 is already hot, and it's still 55 ¡æ! ! ! ! ! It's a pity that I really should play two games before doing the test, and 42¡ãC can't meet the reason for returning. Moreover, Huawei does its own testing for itself, so let's listen to the real situation. When wechat video, the front camera is really garbage, taking pictures is ok, the video is very blurry, not as good as two or three thousand mobile phones. Taking pictures will make you more satisfied. The pictures are very beautiful, and some of them are too beautiful and distorted. There is already a function for shooting night scenes. Using normal mode to shoot night scenes has to be the same as the daytime, which is very impractical and cannot capture the true appearance of night scenes.",,"People who often play games and watch videos should consider it again, the mobile phone is very hot. You can buy it if you like to take pictures, but the lens will be very hot after taking pictures for a long time. The power consumption is ok, it can last for a day (no games, no videos, no vibrato, etc.). It seems that the p40 uses domestic accessories this time. Compared with the p30 of my colleague, the price/performance ratio is average. At least the problem of heat, the p30 does not. The overall performance of the phone is still good, but I don't think it's particularly good. It still needs to be improved, and I'm too anxious to launch it.",
,"It has been used for a day. In contrast, the zero-degree white is not as good as the sky. With a blingbling mobile phone case, it will look a little better than the original phone. The charging and battery life functions are not as fast and high as the p30Pro. I regret it, just to switch to a 5g mobile phone, I reluctantly gave up the p30 and p30Pro. I feel that the p30 series is the pinnacle for the time being, and I have not found the benefits of the new phone. I will continue to support Huawei! It would be better if the realm of the sky could be kept.",,"am used to charging at 20%. Now the usage rate is the same as the previous p30Pro. The basic new phone of the 30Pro was used for more than 24+ hours. The 40Pro also turned on the power saving mode, and the usage time was about 18 hours. Is it better for a 5g phone? Charge some electricity?",
,"Other features: High appearance and high recognition. Photo effect: The photo effect is very good. These five photos were taken at Songshan Lake Scenic Area, as well as Huawei European Town. The last two photos are 5x optical zoom. Battery life: No problem in one day Communication sound quality: clear Running speed: very fast, the first place in the evaluation experience of Master Lu Display effect: yes",,The 5x optical zoom is really cool,
,"I have been using Apple mobile phones all the time, and this time I have been struggling to switch to Huawei. I received it, the mobile phone is very good in all aspects, and I can get started after changing the system in one day.",,"After using it for a few days, I just don't understand why sending friends videos is so slow and laggy. It's really heartbreaking.",
,"Other features: The position on the edge of the surrounding area can only be sensed after three or four clicks. Photo effect: It is not as powerful as the introduction, 50 times can only take 300,000 pixels, and the pixel quality of normal shooting is not very good. Battery life: very average, basically charge it every morning, and make up for it in the afternoon, otherwise it will call the police. Communication sound quality: The signal is still relatively good, much better than the fruit machine.",,"This is the effect of the bragging rights of the camera. I really want to quit. It took me a day to transfer the old phone data. Really embarrassing now! After finally deciding not to use the fruit machine, Huawei treats the fans who have turned over like this",

,"Nice phone, I like it",,"Baby is very delicate, you will never regret buying it",
,The photo doesn't look good.,,"Maybe the photo effect is not as good as I thought, and it's not bad. Other aspects are still very good, smooth! More than 6000 is also worth it",
,"Huawei, domestic products, I hope everyone must support like me!",,The battery is still broken,
,I gave it to my boyfriend. My boyfriend likes it very much. He said it is easier to use than Apple. I also consider getting one.,,"It's expensive to buy. I went to the counter yesterday to see what I bought at 4150 and 5988, and I was immediately drunk!",
,"bought this mobile phone with hard-earned money to buy feelings. It was sent by Huawei, and the price was a little cheaper than the physical store. But there are a lot less things. In one word, go to the physical store to buy, talk about the purchase price, it is better than buying online, there is no wireless charging, no Bluetooth, no tempered film, no things add up to more than 1,000, which is an unequivocal reduction. With version, we carefully choose to buy online. There is only one cheap rubber sleeve.",,"Reduced allocation, not worth buying, don't use hard-earned money to talk about feelings, regret it!",
,"The first time I used Huawei's products and the last time, the product is spicy chicken. The photos I took less than a week after I got it were damaged and could not be opened. The funniest thing about the problem is that they can't solve it themselves, either return it or endure it! I just didn't quit on purpose, I just wanted everyone to see how spicy you guys are! It's not that I don't support domestic products, but the result is just this virtue, which is disappointing!",,"Hehe, don't say high-sounding, your product is poor, and the solution you taught is useless, and there are no functions on the interface at all. Also, I will return it to you, what will I use for office during the period? I'm not picking things up, I'm just letting everyone see how unprofessional you are, how hot you are, and there are system problems that cannot be repaired within a week. I want to understand that you peeped at my privacy and helped me delete photos, or your system Not spicy chicken? Don't maintain it as soon as something happens, what to maintain?

,How come it didn't fall apart?,,"Sorry, I got it wrong, the phone case is cracked",
,"The screen looks like insects crawling on the screen. I don't know if it should be like this or just me. I made a big decision to change it. The X I used before is extremely uncomfortable now, and I am worried that it is an official remake.",,"After some research yesterday, I found out that it was a piece of film that was pasted ??, and then I tore off the film and dropped the phone??, the mood just exploded immediately, the lower left corner was broken, and it was only forty centimeters from the ground, really It's too fragile, please handle it carefully, it's very silky, but the customer service is very supportive. I have a local Huawei service point, and I'll check it out later.",
,"The phone is good, but the logistics and customer service are very poor. First, the delivery was in the wrong area. The courier called and said that Xicheng had delivered to Fengtai, and asked me if I still need my mobile phone? Didn't I ship it wrong? Didn't I write the wrong address? Why do you still want it? You don't want to buy things from your home if you send them to the wrong address? He also asked me if I can't deliver it anyway, what do you want to do with it? I'm not a courier? Did you send the wrong one and ask the customer how to deal with it? When I hung up the phone, I responded to the customer service. The customer service was like I couldn't understand Chinese. They kept asking me to wait for a while to check the logistics for me, saying that I was waiting patiently during the delivery. I said that the courier called and said that you delivered to the wrong area, and asked me: how did you know that? Really speechless! Saying it is the same as not saying it. After changing a few customer service staff, they asked me if I wanted to check the courier! Are you illiterate? Still can't understand Earth language?",,"Don't let your after-sales feedback make those meaningless phone calls and say some meaningless waste of time! Customer service is not my feedback before you go to training! You need to be trained before you can work! What we need is a customer service who can solve my feedback problem. After a long phone call, just to say that we will train customer service later, what's the point? You should start training",
,"It's ok, it's ok, it's ok",,"It's ok in all aspects, but sometimes it's a bit uncomfortable, but it feels fast",
,"It looks beautiful, the phone is great, and the system is quite in line with my taste! Five-star no loss",,"Say something bad! I originally wanted a P40! Small enough to play with one hand! Curved surfaces and cameras are not just necessary for me, but the configuration I want is only available on the pro! pro is big! It really hurts! This seven-star knife is really good! I really thank you from the bottom of my heart!",
,"From p30pro to p40pro, it took only one year to replace and upgrade, just for a feeling, I hope Huawei will break through the siege of the US imperialists, face the difficulties, don't let the Chinese people down, come on Huawei, come on Chian! At the same time, we hope that Huawei will do a good job in supporting services, including express delivery, we must contact customers, improve the customer service capabilities of flagship stores, establish more after-sales service points, and provide convenient and considerate services.",,"I'm sorry, I wrote china as chian by mistake while wearing reading glasses. I apologize to friends who saw this review.",
,"Came for the camera function of the mobile phone, not bad! did not disappoint",,"Not much to say, watch the video",
,"Photo effect: very good! I took a video, and it works! Battery life: charging is fast, and you can use Douyin for most of the day. The cooling of the machine is not very good.",,"Purchased from Huawei Live Room. At that time, it was said how many people had gifts before the hour. As a result, no one could figure out which position they were in, and there was no gift. It was like a trap. The customer service estimated that the answer given by the robot was always irrelevant and repeated constantly. The marketing skills of domestic big brands are so LOW, I have seen it for a long time",
,"The logistics is super fast, because there is no film, so I haven't used it yet, just turn on the machine, wait for a few days after the film",,"The phone has been used for less than a month, and the rear camera has problems. In macro and wide-angle modes, the camera freezes and crashes. Zooming to 8 times is enough to have no change, but it cannot reach 50 times zoom, which seriously affects the use. Came with the camera, and the camera was broken. Later, I saw that I am not the only one who has this situation. Many people have appeared. At present, Huawei has not given any explanation, but only said the warranty. I think it is unacceptable to disassemble and replace a mobile phone after just one month of purchase. The dustproof and waterproof functions will have an impact, and the value of the mobile phone will be greatly depreciated. I asked for a return. At present, the merchant has not given an answer. Huawei said that it is impossible after sales.",
,It is the first time to use Huawei to support domestic production. Not familiar with the phone running out of additional comments.,,"When ordering something on the screen, it takes a few times to click until it feels stuck. If you don't want to click, you click accidentally. When swiping Douyin, I accidentally liked it up and down and was speechless. I didn't do this with Apple before. The first time I used Huawei p40pro, I felt that there was still a gap between it and Apple, that is, the touch screen software did not respond when the software was closed. Please reply to the same question.",
,"Photo effect: The five-fold optical zoom is very, very good, and the ultra-wide-angle is also very good! A phone with almost full focal length, it's awesome, I love it so much",,Selfies are great!,

,"not bad, very nice",,"Swarovski's shell looks good, I feel that with a bracelet, the bulingbuling flash will be even better",
,"Let¡¯s talk about the shortcomings. The first is that when taking pictures and shooting TV, all the surrounding areas of the TV are exposed. Clicking to focus will turn black. It is more or less inconvenient. The letters are too low. The fourth mobile phone is too narrow and long. It is inconvenient to use. The price of the fifth domestic 6500 is too close to the people. will be like me",,"The flashlight is yellow and dark when taking pictures, can you solve it?",
,"Huawei is really fragrant, there is no reason to support you, the delivery will arrive the next day, I really like this color, it is very advanced, and the configuration is not to say that it is very easy to use, recommended to buy!",,"I really like it, and then I will post a photo",
,"Years of P-series pollen from the P8 to a new machine every year 618, the visible changes of this machine except for the front and rear cameras, the frame has become narrower, the top, bottom, left and right are only one millimeter, so the home button is a bit unaccustomed to the display The resolution is obviously higher than the P30Pro. As long as Huawei is alive, I will keep buying it.",,After a friend reminded me that the home button can be set by myself,
,"Very good??Like, 168 discounts are more",,After sales service is very poor. After sales service is very poor. After sales service is very poor.,
,"616 pre-sale made the deposit and then grabbed the goods at 0:00. Then the deposit was handed over and the goods were rushed to 0:00. As a result, the direct store discount on the 18th reduced the price. The customer service said that there was no price guarantee agreement on the order and would not make up the price difference. Nothing has changed, but there are more discounts. We will not guarantee the price. Please don't play this 618 here to deceive consumers. You can sell the goods like this.",,Customer service said no I can return it,
,"The p40pro ordered yesterday afternoon, arrived this morning, the logistics is super fast, and it¡¯s not in the guard room. I like it. I can¡¯t wait to try all the functions. It¡¯s perfect. Haha, Frost Silver is super beautiful, slightly heavier than ordinary mobile phones.",,I only like Huawei and have no other abilities. I can only buy a Huawei mobile phone to silently support Huawei. Come on Huawei,
,"Running speed: very fast Battery life: average, I personally feel that there is no apple xsmax battery to use the photo effect: very good",,"This phone selfie is such a failure, disappointed",
,"First of all, I will give Huawei a five-star praise, because impeccable is not Huawei's **f--, and other mobile phone users should not spray it. Why choose P40P? First of all, it has a 5G network, after all, I also prefer high-tech; secondly, I think the smoothness of Huawei is enough for normal users, and playing various games can be said to be very smooth (if I hold Apple and Huawei than I think it is unnecessary, such as games) What's the point of you fast forward the game by one second than others? I don't play mobile games, so I think that mobile phone enthusiasts should not be serious with me.) Thirdly, Huawei's camera function is very powerful, and the release of the P series is closely related to Apple's The release of the series does not conflict. It can be said that Huawei's P series are ahead of Apple's series. I like to enjoy this top-notch feeling, at least this is the pride that Huawei P series brings me. Fourth, because I used the P30 before, I think the fluency is completely enough, but because there is no 5G network, I am willing to replace it, but it has shrunk a lot of money. Is this the only downside of Huawei? The high-end 11pm and 40P on the back have their own advantages, but Apple's hand feel is slightly better. Apple's hand feel is frosted gray, which I personally prefer. Figure left P40P in P30P right 11PM. For reference only, by the way, Huawei customer service I have to say that compared with Apple, you know 8.",,"Two cases will be reviewed, either very bad or very good, Huawei is particularly good. Following the above shortcomings, my car cannot be connected to an Android phone, but only an Apple carplay, which is a very important factor that prevents me from throwing away my Apple! Huawei's pre-sales and after-sales are in place. Unlike Apple, I have to work hard to find a human now. The picture was taken in a hotel, the laptop has limited pixels, and the light tone is yellowish. The quad-curved bezels of the P40p are comfortable, much better than the 30p. By the way, the mobile phone case and the factory film are also attached. You can go to the Huawei after-sales store to change the film for free. I specifically asked the customer service for this, and I want to give this a big compliment! Apple 12 can't be updated with new tricks, I think I will replace Apple with another mate40p and spray lightly. After reading a lot of questions and answers, I think that 40 and 40p and 40p+ are more than the camera function, battery capacity, size, and color. The purchase depends on the economic strength and your own preferences. One thing that can be compared between Huawei and Apple is the sound. I bought the iPhone 11 in November, and the sound of the speakers has become lower, but I bought the P30P when it came out last year. The volume is not weak, and the charging speed does not need me to say. . Huawei supports the control of various devices, but Apple does not. And the content of Apple's play is not very rich, how can I put it, just like Mercedes-Benz and Audi? I prefer Audi, technology and the future, and Apple seems to be lacking a lot. That's it, if you have any questions, comment on my message. If you see it, you may not be able to reply, because you may not be able to see it. Apple and Huawei fell into the water and I chose to save Huawei. I wish: Huawei can make its own chips in advance, so that I can have a reason to completely convince myself not to use other mobile phones.",
,"The logistics is very fast, the order was placed yesterday, it arrived this morning, and the customer service is also very good. I can't comment on the mobile phone just after I got it. I will follow up with the review after the gift selfie stick is re-sent.

Polish your glasses a little later. stop being fooled",
,"I didn't expect that the logistics of ems is also relatively fast. I took the photo at night and shipped it at night. I like the positive work attitude and high work efficiency. The mobile phone is very fragrant and the size is suitable. Not Zhou Dongyu! The mobile phone is very smooth and user-friendly. The 90 Hz refresh rate is not very noticeable to the naked eye. The new phone has a film, but the film technology is still wrong. There are wrinkles on the left and right sides of the film. It should not be a return or exchange! It is estimated that it will not take long for this to be managed. From the fruit fans, the application authorization is the most uncomfortable! No permission is allowed to use the app!

,"The mobile phone is good, and the running speed is OK. The strange thing is that the back of the mobile phone occupies one-third of the network access license and cannot be torn off. If it is torn off or spent, it will not be guaranteed. This is why you must buy a mobile phone case to protect this network access license. You can't use transparent (affecting the appearance), so why do you still have so many colors from Huawei?",,"It's not that the experience of black Huawei is really bad. It is used, and there is no humanization point for Xiaomi. There are too many defects in the system, all kinds of inconveniences, and even the notification volume cannot be adjusted with the size of the ringtone. I really regret buying Huawei, I knew I would buy Xiaomi.",

I found the screen scratched when I put the tempered film on the fingerprint unlock, so I bought another film online, and it arrived in two or three days. I was very upset, so I contacted the customer service and asked for a simple change of the machine. I didn¡¯t accept changing the screen. From 8:00 pm, the customer service took turns pulling me into the middle of the night, saying that it might be touched by a sharp object when the film was put on or in my pocket. , the first tempered film has not been touched, the second depends on the protective equipment I bought from the Internet, do you think it is possible? I didn't get a good night's sleep because I didn't handle it that night. I woke up early the next day to pack my phone to apply for after-sales service. When I took off the phone case, I found that there were scratches on the bottom of the back of the phone. The phone case was made of silicone. That's 10,000...

Another point is that it does not heat up. After using the P40 series for a long time, you will forget that the phone still heats up.

Later, I saw that this is not Huawei's official store, at most, it is the first place to make money from the agent distributor! Just sell the goods no matter how deep the pit is.

The camera always focuses on taking pictures. It is impossible if you want to take it out suddenly. It is especially annoying. These bad points are behind the phone. If you don't buy a case to wrap it, it is estimated that it will be broken when you drop it. The sound of the external amplifier on the mobile phone is too loud, and the people next door can hear it, which is very bad. The good point is that you can look at the photo below the split screen and send it to WeChat and drag it directly, or you can chat on WeChat while chatting on QQ.",

She wanted to support domestic products and chose Huawei. But the result was too disappointing. Let's talk about the phone itself. The appearance is described in two words: bulky. The clarity and fineness of the screen is much lower than that of Apple; the camera function that has been promoted as a selling point is also incapable of complaining, the color of the photo is seriously distorted, and the color of the automatic mode is yellow and unsaturated. The most unbearable thing is that the freeze phenomenon occurs after a few days of use. Of course, the most ?? beer is the customer service of Huawei's official flagship store.

If it is not for insufficient memory, there is really no problem at all. The only reason to change to P40Pro is to expand the memory.

As a patriotic youth, I am willing to support domestic products, but I hope not to take consumers as **.

I read e-books when I'm not busy. The basic machine does not leave the hand. In 2019, I bought two P30 and mate30. The P30 is still in good condition. In normal use, it has not been repaired and there is no problem. The mate30 has fallen into the water. . . Take this opportunity to get a new one ?? PS: I am just expressing my personal experience.

The customer service said that the receipt has been confirmed, but the customer service also said that if the receipt is not confirmed, the charger will not be sent.

The upper half and the lower half are two temperatures. Hongmeng is not used to it yet, and the overall fluency is OK. Video swiping and blogging should be enough. There are still a lot of apps that come with the new phone. I almost thought it was used by someone else. In fact, the previous P20 is not stuck.

After all, it is only 2,000 yuan. It is absolutely no problem to take pictures for daily use. The mobile phone case is better to buy. My original screen fell on the corner of the curved surface without the case protection. After using it for a while, I felt that it was worse than Apple's bangs (appearance).

,"The performance of the Snapdragon 888 chip is definitely not to worry about. The heat problem is not a big problem for me. The last one plus 8pro Snapdragon 865 is much hotter than this. Photo effect: The photo was taken in the daytime with ten times zoom, which is relatively clear. of. Battery life: If the battery lasts for three hours, the power will be lost 56%. During the period, large-scale games and various movies and videos have been played. For the 4100 battery is very powerful. The system is much better than the previous one. Cried",,"I've been using it for half a month, tell me about the experience. I don¡¯t need to say more about the advantages, let¡¯s focus on the disadvantages 1. Network problem: I don¡¯t know if it¡¯s my card or the location, there will always be a network speed that becomes very slow and I need to open the flight and then close it to get better 2. Fever problem: daily It is not very hot to use, download things and Tencent Video download videos, the heat is particularly serious when running multiple software, and the power consumption is like running water. 3. Battery life problem: The battery life of the daily software is also good, two to three charges a day, but if it is hot as mentioned in the previous article, the battery will drain very quickly. Just don't let it heat up and it will have a better battery life. 4. Game aspects: The last step is to play games. I play CODM, and the performance mode is turned on. In 20 minutes, the power is off by 21 bars, and the heat is relatively serious during the period. It's hard to describe the feeling of playing a game and seeing the battery drop from 95 to 84. If it is still within seven days, I will consider returning it, but if it exceeds that, I will do it and play games as little as possible.

,"The delivery was very fast the next day, the new product is very good to use",,"The small-screen straight-screen mobile phone can really be said to be the first. Regardless of the feel or the screen frame, the control is really just right. The screen has been greatly improved compared to the previous generation, and the sound quality is not to be said. Looking at the current domestic flagship Android phones, About 5,000, I suddenly found that the p50 is very cost-effective, except that there is no 5G, the others are really doing well",
,"Ordered on the 2nd, delivered on the 3rd, and arrived on the 5th, I thought it really had to wait until the 11th to deliver the goods; it did get hot, but only to the extent that I felt warm.

,"From the P8 to the P50, the feeling is as follows: 1. The screen is much longer and wider, and there is little difference when viewing web pages. The screen's response is too fast, and when the phone is moved a little, the unlock page will appear. When reading a web page, I swipe the screen with my fingertips. Every time I swipe, the screen dims a little, which is not very good, and I also feel that the screen is a little fragile. 2. The new machine is much heavier, like a brick compared to the old machine. Because it's so heavy, I take it out of my bag from time to time to take pictures when I go out. 3. When listening to the book, the volume will change and the sound will become smaller. 4. The right volume key and switch key are not easy to press. It may be better not to use the shell. 5. The charging speed is average, the power consumption speed is average, the software is not commonly used, and it is charged once a day. 6. The network speed is a little faster than the old machine, and the software system is used smoothly. 7. The effect of taking pictures is good, often taking pictures of flowers and plants, which is much clearer and brighter than the old machine. 8. I like white, but this snowy white is a bit cold, dark white is not bright white. The old machine has been used for 5 years, the new machine has been used for 5 days, and it is still adapting. If it's not that the old machine is about to fall apart, I still prefer to use the old machine more.",,"customer service lady just contacted me. She analyzed and told me the solutions one by one about the problems I mentioned. The explanation was very professional and very good. I originally planned to give a 5-point satisfaction rating. I hung up the phone and called back again, but I don't know how to find someone. Hope you can see it, sorry. In addition, the problem I am talking about is basically personal experience.

,"won't say anything else, and Huawei's quality certainly doesn't need to be mentioned. I just want to ask, is Huawei going to close down? I buy a mobile phone and send me EMS? ? ? It took four hours to deliver to the school's post office, and I just sent a text message to notify the pickup. I called and asked if I could deliver it to the downstairs of the dormitory, because it was raining and I couldn't ride a bike and walk for 20 minutes. Minutes, the beautiful woman opposite: Hehe, we are very busy now, if you can't come at night, you can come over at nine o'clock tomorrow morning, we will get off work at seven o'clock. To be fair, before buying an Apple, even if it was a pen, I would call ahead to inquire about the convenient door-to-door time, and then send it downstairs to inspect the goods in person. Really good guy, 5000 to buy a 4G mobile phone is not to burn more money, but to support domestic products, the express operation has made me annoyed before I get the mobile phone, that is to say",,"After the evaluation, I received an after-sales phone call and apologized, saying that it was because SF Express and EMS both cooperated with express delivery. See which one is closest to the delivery warehouse, and asked if I needed to ask the person at the express delivery point to apologize to me (I think I may have to take it in the future. Post, forget it). Then the next day the senior account manager called and apologized and said they would send a gift, this time to SF Express.

,"After using it for a few days, the user experience is very good. The Hongmeng system is very smooth and the interaction details are very good. The user experience is better than other domestic products. At present, some functions have not been implemented on the Snapdragon core, waiting for subsequent version updates. Speaking of taking pictures, I have been using the Google pixel series before, so I am no stranger to algorithm optimization for taking pictures. This time Huawei's follow-up is a good start. The algorithmic photography of the pixel series can be said to be a god-like existence in mobile phones. Compared with Google's algorithmic photography, the p50 still has many details that need to be sculpted. Whether it is simplicity or overall color science, it needs to learn from the industry's excellent solutions. In particular, the camera interface has strong engineering design thinking, and the content of the interface is too cumbersome. In fact, for most consumers, they seldom use so many functions with very fine distinctions, but they can take them out at any time. Rather than taking it out and thinking about using that function to distinguish the plan for shooting, this decision should be made by the machine in advance when the user is shooting. The above personal views are for reference only.",,"Video performance is not bad, this part was shot while walking, and there is almost no jitter. The video is made with the editing function of the mobile phone, similar to the clipping of Douyin, and the user experience is quite good.",

,"Specially experienced 2 days to evaluate. Let¡¯s talk about the software first. The Hongmeng system is very powerful. First of all, it has the smoothness and easy operation of Apple IOS. The overall appearance is not much different from the IOS system. Secondly, Hongmeng system has made some more user-friendly designs in the details, so that the system has the playability that IOS does not have. IOS is simple and easy to use, but it is so simple that it has no playability. It has been used for many years since Apple 5. IOS, this time I changed to Hongmeng, and I am not used to it at all. On the contrary, the more I use it, the more I like the Hongmeng system. Speaking of hardware, the design of the phone is very beautiful, the back cover is slightly frosted, not all fingerprints, which is a good design. The screensavers and mobile phone cases are all posted and neatly arranged, very attentive. I like straight screens and don¡¯t like curved screens, so I didn¡¯t buy the P50pro when it came out first. I was just waiting for the P50 with straight screens. Here¡¯s a suggestion for Huawei. The mobile phone must have both curved and straight screens, because different consumption have different preferences. The buttons for adjusting the volume feel better on the left side, making it easier to operate with one hand.",,"If it is a complete market economy and there is no conspiracy, then there should be no moral kidnapping. Consumers are completely free to use the products of which country and which company, regardless of other factors. However, now the beautiful country deliberately suppresses Huawei. It is really disgusting. Everyone has a small family. The Hongmeng system is the next generation of the operating system for the Internet of Everything. It has strategic significance. Get up, let the Chinese have their own operating system, and no longer be stuck by foreign countries. Huawei can be said to be one of the top technology companies in the world. Beautiful country deliberately suppresses Huawei because it is afraid of Huawei's powerful strength. Huawei's 5G and even the future 6G, chips, and operating systems are all powerful. It can be said that the self-confidence of our entire nation will increase. There has been a great improvement, so I suggest that every Chinese son and daughter support Huawei's products. Although it is not unpatriotic to use foreign products, it is an objective fact to support domestic products, especially Huawei Hongmeng, with practical actions. This is also an objective fact. In the current difficult time of my country's high-tech enterprises",

I bought a 66v charger. This is going super fast.",,"Finally found out the reason for the lag... It's actually a phone case problem. Change the phone case and the phone runs very smoothly... The following is the suspected phone case... poisonous. Battery problem: It does drain a little faster. Photo problem: change the camera to take a photo filter, and the film will not be so dark.",
,"It took me a long time to describe my personal feelings and give my friends a reference. First, the photo effect. Personally, I think the macro is remarkable, both the details and the colors are very good. See Figure 1. In normal mode, the system will increase the contrast, saturation, sharpening, dehazing, and dark field after taking a photo. This is the reason why many people report that the photos will be dark and have black borders. At present, there is no button to turn off optimization. In the professional mode, there is no such trouble, basically what you see is what you get, as shown in Figure 2. Telephoto can also be considered, see Figure 3. After non-professional testing, taking pictures continuously for 10 minutes, and measuring less than 40 degrees with a temperature gun, it is completely acceptable to individuals. The stuck problem only exists in the initial stage of each mode. According to the imaging algorithm, it is guessed that the system is performing a comparison operation. Second, the battery life issue. Compared with the products of the same period, it is slightly insufficient. However, after the system setting, the battery life has been significantly improved. Ordinary office workers have no problem persisting until the middle of the night. The king consumes 4-7 power in one round, and it will heat up but not obvious. It is completely acceptable to individuals. It is not ruled out that the same batch of products have different heat.",,"4G problem. Don't say that 5G is useless, after all, there is no 5G, no matter what. For now, plus the fact that someone disassembled the p50pro before and found that the memory needs to be connected with an adapter board and Kirin, we can see how difficult it is for Huawei at the moment. Personally speculate that the next generation or even 2 generations of Huawei mobile phones will be able to use 5G. And 5G is very likely to be like the original 2G and a half, and it has jumped before it is popularized. It is possible that 6G has already started to be promoted when the mobile phone is changed. For the battery life problem, it will be greatly improved after turning off unnecessary notifications, recommending services, and high brushing. Charging problem. The 66w fast charge can be fully charged in 30 minutes, and it will heat up when charging. In daily use, it feels the hottest when charging. The intuitive feeling of heat is the initial heat when an adult male presses the back of his left hand with his right hand at a room temperature of 25 degrees. Of course, everyone feels different, so finding a few more and taking the average is about the same. Yuanshen didn't play, so I don't know how the fever is. When I first got it, it consumed 10 batteries in 10 minutes, which was really scary enough. I ordered the return several times. So far, I feel that the mobile phone is getting better and better every day. Don't talk about the righteousness of the family and the country, after all, most of them are ordinary people, and they don't talk about patriotism. After all, the feelings are not only about Huawei, Huawei is not only about P50, and they don't comment on morality. After all, 4,000 yuan is not a wind blowing, it is hard money. But don't slander it if you don't like it. As far as the current use is concerned, everything is fine, and it's not as bad as it says. Finally, I hope that Huawei can move forward bravely against the current, and can further optimize the software, so that the P50 mobile phone can be further improved.",

I was very surprised at this, and it was a good job. However, the work efficiency of the after-sales point is very slow. The people in front have walked away for a long time on the phone. They just do their own thing and play with their mobile phones. Looking anxious. There is no problem with the maintenance, and they will not call me immediately. I see that the time is about to close, so I call to ask, they have no customers there and they are not busy, but they just don't take the initiative to contact me, I have been downstairs It's very inconvenient to walk around stupidly with children, and I feel very dissatisfied with the after-sales service point.",

It's about to accept her and look forward to better products",,"The mobile phone must be tall, with exquisite workmanship and attractive appearance. The domestic Hongmeng system is comfortable to look at. Although there is no 5G, it doesn¡¯t matter to me. There is wifi everywhere. The 4G network speed is also OK.",

,"I have always used Huawei, and this time I struggled with the 50pro and 13. I really don¡¯t like the curved screen, but I came out with this one. I insisted on giving it a try. I bought what the market has always said is hot, and sure enough, my phone is a moderate patient. Work needs, plus daily. Brush will be Taobao, hot, vibrato, hot, WeChat more, hot.

,"Received it the next day, really fast, my wife loves it",,"I have been using Huawei, the Hongmeng system is really powerful, and my wife has also changed from Apple to Huawei. Zhonghua Youwei wishes the motherland prosperity and prosperity.",
,"The first time I bought it, because everyone said it was good, I bought it, but the experience was poor. My main concern is battery life, but this battery life is simply garbage. After sleeping on the Internet, more than ten percent of the battery is gone, and I am convinced. If you use it, it will drop 20% of the electricity in an hour, what kind of thing.",,"Hehe, I lost 80% of the electricity in the morning, and I took it. What kind of thing is it to deceive consumers? Other people's money is blown by the wind? It's not difficult to buy a good mobile phone for more than 4,000 yuan, what a piece of junk.",
,"The new mobile phone is still very accustomed to operate, that is, the original mobile phone is too old, there is no way to clone it, and it can only be rebuilt! Also, is there no memory card in Huawei now? It turns out that the photos of the card have to be put in, which is inconvenient! At the beginning, it is very fast to use. Before the mate10 was used for the fourth year, I only started to use it. I hope that the current Hongmeng will be stronger. Don't be stuck!",,"Alas, a relatively disappointing mobile phone, the previous mate10 only started to get stuck in the fourth year of use.

Now it has been used for a period of time. It will get hot, but it's fine in winter, but I don't know if it will be particularly hot in summer. It's very nice to take pictures. If it's not used for a while, it's probably hot, and the signal feels normal. If you can buy 5g, you should buy 5g.",,"After using it for a period of time, the mobile phone is fully charged in 45 minutes when it is not playing. It is very hot when playing, it is hot and stuck, and the charging is also very slow. Usually I play for too long and it gets hot, and it freezes when it gets hot. I don¡¯t know if it¡¯s because of the Snapdragon 88, and I don¡¯t know if the 5,000-dollar phone is because I¡¯m asking too much of him? I feel like even my old machine is not as good?

Do not study well!",,"When I bought the p40 last year, there was a charger as standard, but this year's p50 is gone, and I need to add 199 to buy a charger separately. In other words, this set of chargers is worth 199. But I want to ask, the standard price has not been reduced, why not give the charger? If you choose the standard configuration and there is no charger, should you deduct the 199? This small account is for you! Who did you learn this from? A fruit? Someone gave me a data cable! Is it good to study? Huawei has won a lot of glory for the country, and now more and more people are abandoning Apple and supporting Huawei. I want to say, Huawei, don't let the people who support you chill. Your price itself is not cheap, and you have to account for those small accounts. As a national enterprise, can't we be good at it?",

I don¡¯t play games, I basically don¡¯t watch TV, and I use my mobile phone to use the battery normally. I can only use the fruit I used a day ago. It took half a day to replace Huawei's battery, but it still needs to be improved. The feel is OK and the appearance is OK.",
,"I don't feel hot, the response is very fast, I like charging, but the power consumption is a bit heavy, standby for seven hours at night, using 7%",,I'm a little sorry,

The flashback is pretty smooth.",,"For example, if a few small dots in the upper right corner of the video flicker to check after-sales, it is possible to touch the sensor, which does not affect the use.

,"The camera function is powerful, the fingerprint recognition is fast, the battery and charging are also the first, the color, style and texture of the mobile phone are very good, and there is a unique Hongmeng system. It is the Chinese who should buy domestic mobile phones. The US sanctioned China and prevented Huawei from producing 5G mobile phones. In fact, it is the most stupid act. Now that Huawei's quality in all aspects is hanging on Apple's mobile phones, their sales are threatened, so they use this incompetence s method. So resolutely do not buy Apple products, and never do anything to slap your face!",,"The charging is very fast, and after using it for a period of time, it unlocks many useful small functions of Huawei, which is very convenient. The size of the mobile phone is also just right and not heavy. It can be used by both men and women. Fortunately, I bought it early. At present, many are out of stock and it is difficult to buy. I have to wait patiently for shipment.",

,"Straight screen party, the appearance is what I like",,"started to worry about 888 pulling my hips. After I got it, I tried the game. It was not as serious as the forum fever described, and it did not affect the use at all. The screen of this generation has been greatly improved, and it feels not inferior to Apple. The only 5G regret has no effect on actual use, so it is a rare direct-screen flagship.",

I called Huawei customer service and asked if there was anything wrong. The customer service said that they would arrange for someone to reply.

I play with the same frequency as the Xiaomi note 3. After three years, the Mi Note 3 is charged twice a day. save. I found it twice, and after the screen recording ended, it was gone. I didn't save it at all. 4 It took two months to get stuck. It is possible that everyone who plays games should buy a 2000 millet. I really haven't found a better experience than a 2400 millet.

,"don't mention any configuration. I will say, this Hongmeng system. I am using a Huawei phone for the first time. I don't know about the past and present, and I chose this one just to take pictures of my children. As a result, as shown in Figure 1 and 2, it is easy to enter the emergency call when the screen is locked. Then, this is the designer's own cleverness, sticking all 110, and can't delete the changes according to the customer's needs. A bear child, it is easy to call. I have searched and many mothers have this problem. For now, solving can only turn off any smart settings. When the interface of the old computer is used. I have been using a friend business before, and there is no such situation where the customer can't close the change and disgusting. Plus, that wise assistant, too. It's like when you enter the mall and a bunch of people come around and ask you if you need anything. The metaphor may not be appropriate. However, any software that cannot be uninstalled and closed according to the customer's wishes, I personally think it is a joke. Figure 3 shows that the charging icon is displayed even though I am not charging, and it can be removed only after turning it on again and again.",,"Huawei customer service still likes it. The first time, communicate with me to solve it. Except Figure 1 is a programming problem. Others have been solved perfectly. Correction, Smart Assistant can be turned off. Yes I will not use.

Then I specially found a Huawei P10, 22.5W charger to charge, but the power is more durable than the 66W fast charge! Find a rule, slow charging batteries are more durable!

The mobile phone I used is also using 4G. In this way, the third is that the virtual navigation console sometimes disappears and hides suddenly.

The sticker is really either not there or not good! what! This year finally let me wait until the p50 is facing the screen. I recently went to Taobao and saw that I could take a picture and quickly took it. I received it on the third day! The cocoa tea gold is really good-looking and feels very good! Very nice! The charger was also photographed by the flagship store. The charging is very fast. After a few days of getting used to it, all aspects are not bad. Basically, there is no problem in using electricity for a day! The mobile phones of 6 people and 5 people in the family are all Huawei mobile phones, and the signal is better than that of other brands of mobile phones before! I just want to complain about cloning. Everyone can clone it directly. I have changed WiFi for a long time and have not been able to connect successfully! Later, the mobile phone contacts and mobile phone albums were all manually entered, and the Bluetooth transmission",,The front camera pixel is really super invincible,

It is recommended to buy the mate40 series",,"To be honest, when I first saw that the phone was hot in the comment section, I thought it couldn't be hotter than Xiaomi. I didn't expect that even through the thick phone case, I could feel the heat! The heat is not low, if it weren't for a thicker phone case, it might be hot! I also played on and off for five hours, watching videos, and swiping Weibo, what did I do? Why is it so hot?",

I can't charge it after 7 in the morning, and it almost shuts down at 4 or 5 in the afternoon. I haven't got off work yet. No, Apple 13 has a minimum of at least no card, and it is a work phone. It is no different from a low-end machine. Now a low-end machine is no different from a high-end machine as a work machine.

Display effect: The eye protection effect is obvious, and the eyes are not tired after long-term use, which is much better than apples. After the Hongmeng system came out, I liked this mode of operation very much. I bought a few Huawei devices and eliminated the Android and Apple devices I used before. I have used the P50 for a few days, and talk about the experience. The heat phenomenon exists but is not obvious unless I play high-end games, and it does not heat up at all under normal use. Except that the battery life is not particularly long, and there are occasional lags when playing high-end games, other aspects are completely the standard of top flagships.",,"There is no need to worry about just 4G mobile phones.

I'm just hanging there",,"Except for the power failure, there are no other problems for the time being. I hope there will be improvements, not as good as the previous model.

,"I replaced the p50 with the mate30. I thought it would be better than the mate30, but I was a little disappointed. Although it was lighter, the memory I bought was large. Before, the memory of the phone was not enough. My mate30 was charged three times in two days, and it was normal after two years. , but the new phone is charged three times in two days and I feel that it should not be.

After putting on the phone case, the experience of the return button is extremely poor! Apple doesn't send chargers, and now Huawei doesn't send them either? ! The headphone jack has also been changed to a charging hole! It is inconvenient to enter only one fingerprint lock, only two stars.

The battery is much worse than Huawei p30, charge it twice a day. 3. The functions are not much better than the Huawei p30 two or three years ago. Unfortunately, there is no Huawei p30, otherwise I would want to buy the Huawei p30. Huawei has really exhausted my last good impression.

In short, the price is very low, not recommended to buy",,"The front is quite blurry, this is the rear picture. There is no charger, and the power consumption is too fast.

The appearance is beautiful, and I like to face the screen directly. There is no need to praise Hongmeng 2.0. It is smooth and easy to use. As for the chip, there is not much difference when using it, but the game has not experienced it. Battery life is definitely enough for taking pictures. The key price is suitable for the people.

,"Communication sound quality: The new phone is still plugged into the card test, but the alarm is very loud. Trust Huawei's call quality. Other features: Wide-angle is suitable for taking ID photos and taking panoramic views, which is a must for me. The maximum telephoto is 50 times, but more than 20 times the noise is a lot. (The 15x zoom of the car, the distance of 30-40 meters, the effect is very good) Display effect: The color reproduction is very full. OLED is very mature. I don't play games, so 60, 90, 120Hz refreshes make no difference to me, and still pictures are much better than my previous glory. Reason for choosing: I am used to the candy bar, so I insisted on choosing the P50E. Although it does not support 5G, I also did not have a 5G package. During the epidemic, don¡¯t wander around. I mainly use it to take ID photos. I took a fancy to the Leica camera. I was amazed by the P30 in 2018. It's more convenient than a camera--roughly equivalent to the camera effect of a card camera, with PS in the later stage, I don't need a mobile phone to bring a filter. The focus is very stable, there is no blur in walking photos, and the autofocus does not feel the delay. The preferred mobile phone for Selfie control. Others: The system comes with Hongmeng 2.0, and it has been upgraded to 2.0.1 after booting. Swipe the screen to open applications, turn pages, and be smooth and smooth, but you still need to be familiar with gestures. Picture 4, 15x telephoto, 30-40 meters, Picture 5, 30 telephoto, 50-70 meters (test it, it won't take pictures secretly -- illegal) distance. No games, no tests. I will add more later.",,"Talk about the feeling of the trial in the past two days (spray detour). 1. Operation: swipe left and right to the middle to return to the previous interface, swipe up and right to the ""Control Center"" - mobile phone function settings, swipe up and down to the left is the """" message prompt"" of various applications, and quickly swipe from the bottom to the top to return to """" ""Desktop"", hold down and swipe up is the recently opened """"app card"", used to switch apps. My N7 four years ago, and the Honor mobile phone three and a half years ago has transitioned to today's full screen, so I'm going to talk about the operation. 2. The sound playback and prompt sound are both stereo, you can feel that the sound has a certain softness and three-dimensional effect, of course, it is incomparable with the sound--any mobile phone playback can not be compared with the sound. 3. Open these two days Taobao, WeChat, Alibaba, Alipay, EZVIZ Cloud Video, WPS and other commonly used APPs are all opened instantly (except for advertisements), and there is no situation where the pictures need to be refreshed again on the first day - the router needs to be restarted due to network problems. Still taking pictures, compared with the AI lens group, the Leica-certified lens group still has obvious advantages. The P50 and nova8 counters have personally tested them, which are more delicate, full of colors, and clear edges. It can be compared to the card camera with CMOS sensor. The amount of light is mine 3-4 times that of the Honor 8. In the past, when taking ID photos, the exposure must be increased to 30-45 in the later stage, especially at night because of the light source problem. , the edge is prone to blurring. Now these problems are solved very well, and post-exposure is not required.",

,"From 7:29 am to 8:21 am on April 18, 2022, I tested the light metering situation of Huawei P50E's new mobile phone professional camera mode again: when the exposure EV value is adjusted to -1, the focal length is in the wide-angle (w ) to 0.7x (0.7x), when the focal length is changed manually and repeatedly, the screen appears white; when the focal length is manually adjusted to 0.8 times (0.8w) or higher, the screen returns to a normal state of being visible. Attached below are the video footage and screenshot comparison pictures during the test (pay attention to the parameter display in the picture). As a new purchaser, I have tested the state of the two new Huawei P50E mobile phones before and after taking photos in professional mode, and the results at least reflect the problem of poor stability in the professional camera program design or parameter gradient settings of Huawei P50E mobile phones ( Please note: I have also tested the same setting and shooting scene with Huawei P40 mobile phone, and the above white screen problem does not exist at all). It is hoped that Huawei will attach great importance to the above-mentioned product defects and strengthen improvements to meet the basic requirements for users to use them with confidence.",,"have seen the advertisement of the Huawei P50E mobile phone made by a CEO of Huawei on the big TV screen in the Huawei Service Center store. But what about practicality? Do you still think so after using it? Why do Huawei companies or merchants ignore the negative comments in the comment area, and do not give a convincing statement about the quality defects of the products that are well-founded? Even if it is to say that there are quality defects that need to be improved in the future, it will make the user's disappointed heart somewhat comforted! I am an old user of Huawei, and I have bought all kinds of series to mate40 Porsche collector's edition. How can we build trust in the future? If the P50E mobile phone really does not have the quality problems mentioned above, it should stand up to the user's use test, because high-quality electronic products are not afraid of repeated operations by users during trial. If the Huawei P50E mobile phone is really like the eye-catching slogan above - what you see is what you see, it should be able to do it - what you see is what you take. And now the white screen phenomenon that no image can be seen, makes it impossible for users to get the image they want in a timely manner! This intermittent, sometimes good and sometimes bad operation experience brings users inexplicable troubles and worries, which seriously reduces users' expectations and trust in Huawei mobile phones. The service concept of customer first becomes a sentence. Empty talk?",

The reply was really interesting. It turned out that you considered that the user already has a Huawei charger and data cable, so the charger and data cable are no longer standard. I think Clearly tell you what the user has, that is the user's personal property, so you don't need to guess. In addition, why do your pads, notebooks, etc. come standard with power supplies, why don't you need to consider that the user may already have related accessories, so the customer There's nothing that doesn't appear to be standard-sounding rhetoric that you can modify at will. I sincerely suggest that at present, the chips are restricted. What you need to do is how to retain old Huawei mobile phone users and develop new users. Customer-centricity is the foundation of your life.",
